    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad\n",
    "\n",
    "Mannambeth\n",
    "\n",
    "and we are going through the Certified Kubernetes Administrators Course. In this section of the course,\n",
    "\n",
    "we will start with understanding the kubernetes security primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does someone gain access to the kubernetes cluster and how are their actions controlled etc at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then start with the various Authentication mechanisms available.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the default settings in the cluster and we practice viewing configurations of an existing\n",

    "cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss about TLS Certificates and how various components within the cluster are secured using TLS\n",
    "\n",
    "certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a kubernetes administrator and you setup a cluster on your own, you are bound to face challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "related to certificates. Which is why we discuss these from ground up from the absolute basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the sections that I spent a lot of time on. I wanted to simplify some of the core concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "around certificates which is why I have added a number of pre-requisite lectures for those who are new\n",
    "\n",
    "to this topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sent out a poll while working on this section to understand your knowledge about TLS certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "and most of you said, you were absolute beginners, which is why we thought it would be good to explain\n",
    "\n",
    "some of these well. Especially since there are so many certificates used within the cluster between various\n",
    "\n",
    "components and it can be quite confusing for a beginner.\n",
    "\n",
    "These lectures and the practice test associated with them should help bridge that gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you might have to be a bit patient with me on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to enable you to tackle any security related or certificate related issues by the end of\n",
    "\n",
    "this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "These prerequisite lectures may not be for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "So depending on your level of expertise with certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to skip some of these lectures as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then move on to authorization. Where we look at the various authorization mechanisms and we focus\n",
    "\n",
    "specifically on role based access controls.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then discussed how to secure images in your environment followed by security contacts and finally\n",
    "\n",
    "network policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a lot of lectures and practice tests coming up.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we look at the security primitives in Kubernetes. Kubernetes being the goto\n",
    "\n",
    "platform for hosting production grid applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "security is of prime concern. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we look at the various security primitives in Kubernetes at a high level before diving deeper into those\n",
    "\n",
    "in the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with the host that formed the cluster itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course all access to these hosts must be secured, root access disabled, password based authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "disabled, and only SSH key based authentication to be made available.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course any other measures you need to take to secure your physical or virtual infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "that hosts kubernetes. Of course if that is compromised, everything is compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus in this lecture is more on Kubernetes related security.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the risks and what measures do you need to take to secure the cluster. As we have seen already,\n",
    "\n",
    "the kube-api server is at the center of all operations within kubernetes. We interact with it through\n",
    "\n",
    "the kubectl utility or by accessing the API directly and through that you can perform almost any\n",
    "\n",
    "operation on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that’s the first line of defense. Controlling access to the API server itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to make two types of decisions who can access the cluster and what can they do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who can access the API server is defined by the Authentication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways that you can authenticate to the API server. Starting with user IDs and passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "stored in a static file, to tokens, certificates or even integration with external authentication providers\n",
    "\n",
    "like LDAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally for machines we create service accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at these in more detail in the upcoming lectures. Once they gain access to the cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "What can they do is defined by authorization mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorization is implemented using Role Based Access Control, where users are associated to groups with\n",
    "\n",
    "specific permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition there are other authorization modules like Attribute based access control, Node Authorizers,\n",
    "\n",
    "webhooks etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we look at these in more detail in the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "All communication with the cluster, between the various components such as the ETCD cluster, kube controller\n",
    "\n",
    "manager, scheduler, api server, as well as those running on the worker nodes such as the kubelet and\n",
    "\n",
    "and kubeproxy is secured using TLS Encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a section entirely for this where we discuss and practice how to setup the certificates between\n",
    "\n",
    "the various components.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about communication between applications within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default all PODs can access all other PODs within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can restrict access between them using Network Policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at how exactly that is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in the network policy section.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that was a high level overview of the various security primitives in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at these in much more detail going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 95. Authentication\n",

    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296084#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on authentication in a Kubernetes cluster as we have seen already\n",
    "\n",
    "the kubernetes cluster consists of multiple nodes physical/virtual and various components that work\n",
    "\n",
    "together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have users like Administrators that access the cluster to perform administrative tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The developers that access to cluster to test or deploy applications we have end users who access the\n",
    "\n",
    "applications deployed on the cluster and we have third party applications accessing the cluster for\n",
    "\n",
    "integration purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this section we will discuss how to secure our cluster by securing the communication between\n",
    "\n",
    "internal components and securing management access to the cluster through authentication and authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture our focus is on securing access to the kubernetes cluster with authentication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "so we talked about the different users that may be accessing the cluster security of end users who access\n",
    "\n",
    "the applications deployed on the cluster is managed by the applications themselves internally. So we\n",
    "\n",
    "will take them out of our discussion. Our focus is on users access to the kubernetes cluster for administrative\n",
    "\n",
    "purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we are left with two types of users. Humans, such as the Administrators and Developers and Robots such\n",
    "\n",
    "as other processes/services or applications that requires access to the cluster. Kubernetes does\n",
    "\n",
    "not manage user accounts natively it relies on an external source like a file with user details or certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "or a third party identity service like LDAP to manage these users. And so you cannot create users\n",
    "\n",
    "in a kubernetes cluster or view the list of users like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in case of Service Accounts kubernetes can manage them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create and manage service accounts using the Kubernetes API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a section on service accounts exclusively where we discuss and practice more about service accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this section we will focus on users in kubernetes. All user access is managed by the API server. Weather\n",
    "\n",
    "you are accessing the cluster through kubectl tool or the API directly,\n",
    "\n",
    "all of these requests go through the kube api server. The kube-api server authenticates the requests before\n",
    "\n",
    "processing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the kube-api server authenticate?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different authentication mechanisms that can be configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have a list of username and passwords in a static password file, or usernames and tokens in\n",
    "\n",
    "a static token file or you can authenticate using certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "And another option is to connect to third party authentication protocols like LDAP, Kerberos etc\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at some of these next let's start with static password and token files as it is the easiest\n",
    "\n",
    "to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the simplest form of authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a list of users and their passwords in a csv file and use that as the source for user\n",
    "\n",
    "information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file has three columns password user name and user I.D..\n",
    "\n",
    "We then pass the file name as an option to the kube-api server. Remember the kube-api server service\n",
    "\n",
    "and the various options we looked at earlier in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where you must specify this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must then restart the kube-api server for these options to take effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you setup your cluster using the kubeadm tool, then you must modify the kube-apiserver POD definition\n",
    "\n",
    "file. Kube-adm\n",
    "\n",
    "tool will automatically restart the kube-api server once you update the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To authenticate using the basic credentials while accessing the API server specify the user and password\n",
    "\n",
    "in a curl command like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the csv file with the user details that we saw we can optionally have a fourth column with the group\n",
    "\n",
    "details to assign users to specific groups similarly instead of a static password file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have a static token file here instead of password you specify a token pass the token file as\n",
    "\n",
    "an option token-auth-file to the kube-api server. While authenticating specify the token as an Authorization\n",
    "\n",
    "bearer token to your requests like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that this authentication mechanism that stores user names, passwords and tokens in clear text in\n",
    "\n",
    "a static file is not a recommended approach as it is insecure.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I thought this was the easiest way to understand the basics of authentication in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward we will look at other authentication mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also want to point out that if you were trying this out in a kubeadm setup you must also consider\n",
    "\n",
    "volume mounts to pass in the auth file. Details about these are available in the article that follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember to set up authorization for the new users we will discuss about authorization later in\n",
    "\n",
    "this course in the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss about Certificate based authentication and how the various components within the kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "are secured using certificates.\n",

    "## 98. TLS Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296090#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this video on understanding SSL TLS certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we will look at the absolute basics of what TLS certificates are why you need them and\n",
    "\n",
    "how you can configure certificates to secure SSH or web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A certificate is used to guarantee trust between two parties during a transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when a user tries to access a web server, TLS certificates ensure that the communication\n",
    "\n",
    "between the user and the server is encrypted and the server is who it says it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at a scenario. Without secure connectivity,\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user were to access his online banking application the credentials he types in would be sent in\n",
    "\n",
    "a plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hacker sniffing network traffic could easily retrieve the credentials and use it to hack into the\n",
    "\n",
    "user's bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's obviously not safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you must encrypt the data being transferred using encryption keys the data is encrypted using a key\n",
    "\n",
    "which is basically a set of random numbers and alphabets you add the random number to your data and\n",
    "\n",
    "you encrypted into a format that cannot be recognized the data is then sent to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hacker sniffing the network gets the data but can't do anything with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the same is the case with the server receiving the data it cannot decrypt that data without\n",
    "\n",
    "the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a copy of the key must also be sent to the server so that the server can decrypt and read the message\n",
    "\n",
    "since the key is also sent over the same network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker can sniff that as well and decrypt that data with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a secure way of encryption but since it uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data and\n",
    "\n",
    "since the key has to be exchanged between the sender and the receiver there is a risk of a hacker gaining\n",
    "\n",
    "access to the key and decrypting the data and that's where asymmetric encryption comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using a single key to encrypt and decrypt data asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys\n",
    "\n",
    "a private key and a public key well they are private and public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for the sake of this example we will call it a private key and a public lock we will get back to\n",
    "\n",
    "that at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now think of it as a key and a lock pair a key which is only with me.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's private.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lock that anyone can access.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's public.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick here is if you encrypt or lock the data with your lock you can only open it with the associated\n",
    "\n",
    "key.\n",
    "\n",
    "So your key must always be secure with you and not be shared with anyone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's private.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the lock is public and may be shared with others but they can only lock something with it no matter\n",
    "\n",
    "what is locked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the public lock it can only be unlocked by your private key before we go back to our Web server\n",
    "\n",
    "example.\n",
    "\n",
    "let’s look at an even simpler use case of securing SSH access to servers through key pairs. You\n",
    "\n",
    "have a server in your environment that you need access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't want to use passwords as they're too risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you decide to use key pairs you generate a public and private key pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by running the ssh_keygen command.\n",
    "\n",
    "It creates two files. Id_rsa is the private key and id_rsa.pub\n",
    "\n",
    "is the public key. Well, not a public key, a public\n",
    "\n",
    "lock. You then secure your server by locking down all access to it, except through a door that is locked\n",
    "\n",
    "using your public lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's usually done by adding an entry with your public key into the servers.\n",
    "\n",
    ".ssh authorized_keys file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you see the look is public and anyone can attempt to break through.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as long as no one gets their hands on your private key which is safe with you on your laptop no\n",
    "\n",
    "one can gain access to the server. When you try to SSH you specify the location of your private\n",
    "\n",
    "key in your SSH command.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you have other servers in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you secure more than one server with your key pair?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well you can create copies of your public clock and place them on as many servers as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the same private key to SSH into all of your servers securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if other users need access to your servers well they can do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can generate their own public and private key pairs as the only person who has access to those\n",
    "\n",
    "servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create an additional door for them and lock it with their public locks copy their public locks\n",
    "\n",
    "to all the servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "And now other users can access the servers using their private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to our Web server example.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see the problem we had earlier with symmetric encryption was that the key used to encrypt data had\n",
    "\n",
    "to be sent to the server over the network along with the encrypted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so there is a risk of the hacker getting the key to decrypt the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could somehow get the key to the server safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the key is safely made available to the server the server and client can safely continue communication\n",
    "\n",
    "with each other using symmetric encryption to securely transfer the symmetric key from the client to\n",
    "\n",
    "the server, we use Asymmetric Encryption. So, we generate a public and private key pair on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to refer to the public lock as public key going forward now that you have got the idea that\n",
    "\n",
    "The ssh-keygen command we used earlier creates a pair of keys for SSH purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the format is a bit different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use the openssl command to generate a private and public key pair. And that’s how they look.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user first accesses the web server using https, he gets the public key from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the hacker is sniffing all traffic that is assumed he too gets a copy of the public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see what he can do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact the user's browser then encrypts the symmetric key using the public key provided by the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric key is now secure the user then sends this to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hacker also gets a copy the server uses the private key to decrypt the message and retrieve the\n",
    "\n",
    "symmetric key from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However the hacker does not have the private key to decrypt and retrieve the symmetric key from the\n",
    "\n",
    "message it received the hacker only has the public key with which he can only lock or encrypt a message\n",
    "\n",
    "and not decrypt the message the symmetric key is now safely available only to the user and the server\n",
    "\n",
    "they can now use the symmetric key to encrypt data and sent to each other the receiver can use the same\n",
    "\n",
    "symmetric key to decrypt data and retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hacker is left with the encrypted messages and public keys with which he can decrypt any data with\n",
    "\n",
    "asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have successfully transferred the symmetric keys from the user to the server and what's symmetric\n",
    "\n",
    "encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have secured all future communication between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect the hacker now looks for new ways to hack into our account and so he realizes that the only\n",
    "\n",
    "way he can get your credential is by getting you to type it into a form he presents.\n",
    "\n",
    "So he creates a Web site that looks exactly like your bank's web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graphics are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Web site is a replica of the actual bank's Web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "He hosts the website on his own server.\n",
    "\n",
    "He wants you to think it's secure too.\n",
    "\n",
    "So he generates his own set of public and private key pairs and configure them on his web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally he somehow manages to tweak your environment or your network to route your requests going\n",
    "\n",
    "to your bank's web site to his servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open up your browser and type the website address in you see a very familiar page the same\n",
    "\n",
    "login page of your bank that you're used to seeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you go ahead and type in the username and password. You made sure you typed in HTTPS in\n",
    "\n",
    "the URL to make sure that communication is secure encrypted your browser receives the key you send encrypted\n",
    "\n",
    "symmetric key and then you send your credentials encrypted with the key and the receiver decrypt the\n",
    "\n",
    "credentials with the same symmetric key you've been communicating securely in an encrypted manner but\n",
    "\n",
    "with the hackers server. As soon as you send in your credentials, you see a dashboard that doesn’t look\n",
    "\n",
    "very much like your bank's dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you could look at the key you received from the server and see if it is a legitimate key from\n",
    "\n",
    "the real bank server when the server since the key it does not send the key alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "It sends a certificate that has the key in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take a closer look at the certificate you will see that it is like an actual certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in a digital format it has information about who the certificate is issued to the public key of\n",
    "\n",
    "that server the location of that server etc. on the right you see the output of an actual certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "every certificate has a name on it the person or subject to whom the certificate is issued to.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is very important as that is the field that helps you validate their identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is for a web server this must match what the user types in the you are on his browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the bank is known by any other names and if they like their users to access their application with\n",
    "\n",
    "the other names as well then all those names should be specified in the certificate under the subject\n",
    "\n",
    "alternative name section.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you see anyone can generate a certificate like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could generate one for yourself saying you're Google and that's what the hacker did in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "He generated a certificate saying he is your bank's web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you look at a certificate and verify if it is legit.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where the most important part of the certificate comes into play who's signed and issued the\n",
    "\n",
    "certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you generate the certificate then you will have to sign it by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is known as a self signed certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone looking at the certificate you generated will immediately know that it is not a safe certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "because you have signed if you looked at the certificate you received from the hacker closely you would\n",
    "\n",
    "have noticed that it was a fake certificate that was signed by the hacker himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of fact your browser does that for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the web browsers are built in with a Certificate validation mechanism, wherein the browser checks\n",
    "\n",
    "the certificate received from the server and validates it to make sure it is legitimate if it identifies\n",
    "\n",
    "it to be a fake certificate then it actually warns you.\n",
    "\n",
    "So then how do you create a legitimate certificate for your web servers that the web browsers will trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you get your certificates signed by someone with authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where Certificate Authorities or CAs comes in. They are well known organizations that can sign\n",
    "\n",
    "and validate your certificates for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the popular ones are Symantec, Digicert, Comodo, GlobalSign etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works is you generate a certificate signing a request or CSR using the key you generated\n",
    "\n",
    "earlier and the domain name of your Web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this again using the open SSL command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates a my-bank.csr file which is the certificate signing request that should be\n",
    "\n",
    "sent to the CA for signing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks like this the certificate authorities verify your details and once it checks out they sign\n",
    "\n",
    "the certificate and send it back to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a certificate signed by a CA that the process trust if hacker tried to get his certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "signed the same way he would fail during the validation phase and his certificate would be rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "by the CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the Web site that he's hosting won't have a valid certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAs use different techniques to make sure that you are the actual owner of that domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have a certificate signed by CA that the browser is trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do the browsers know that the CA itself was legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example what if the certificate was signed by a fake CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case our certificate was signed by Symantec.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would the browser know Symantec is a valid CA and that the certificate was infact signed by Symantec\n",
    "\n",
    "and not by someone who says they are semantec. The CA is themselves have a set of public and private\n",
    "\n",
    "key pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CA is use their private keys to sign the certificates the public keys of all the CAs are built in to\n",
    "\n",
    "the browsers. The browser uses the public key of the CA to validate that the certificate was actually\n",
    "\n",
    "signed by the CA themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can actually see them in the settings of your web browser, under certificates. They are under trusted\n",
    "\n",
    "CAs tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now these are public CAs that help us ensure the public websites we visit, like our banks, email etc\n",
    "\n",
    "are legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However they don't help you validate sites hosted privately say within your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for accessing your payroll or internal email applications. For that you can host your own\n",
    "\n",
    "private CAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these companies listed here have a private offering of their services. A CA server that\n",
    "\n",
    "you can deploy internally within your company.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then have the public key of your internal CA server installed on all your employees browsers\n",
    "\n",
    "and establish secure connectivity within your organization so let's summarize real quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen why you may want to encrypt messages being sent over a network to encrypt messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use asymmetric encryption with a pair of public and private keys and admin uses a pair of keys to\n",
    "\n",
    "secure SSH connectivity to the servers. The server uses a pair of keys to secure HTTPS traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this the server first sends a certificate signing request to a CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CA uses its private key to sign the CSR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember all users have a copy of the CAs public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The signed certificate is then sent back to the server the server configure is the web application with\n",
    "\n",
    "the signed certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a user accesses the web application the server first sends the certificate with its public\n",
    "\n",
    "key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user or rather the user's browser reads the certificate and uses the CA's public key to validate\n",
    "\n",
    "and retrieve the servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public key it then generates a symmetric key that it wishes to use going forward for all communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric key is encrypted using the server as public key and sent back to the server the server\n",
    "\n",
    "uses its private key to decrypt the message and retrieve the symmetric key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetric key is used for communication going forward so the administrator generates a key pair\n",
    "\n",
    "for securing SSH.\n",
    "\n",
    "the web server generates a key pair for securing the web site with HTTPS, the Certificate Authority\n",
    "\n",
    "generates its own set of key pair to sign certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end user though only generates a single symmetric key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once he establishes trust with the Web site he uses his username and password to authenticate the Web\n",
    "\n",
    "server with the servers key pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client was able to validate that the server is who they say they are but the server does not for\n",
    "\n",
    "sure know if the client is who they say they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be a hacker impersonating a user by somehow gaining access to his credentials not over the\n",
    "\n",
    "network for sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "as we have secured it already with TLS. May be some other means. Anyway,\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can the server do to validate that the client is who they say they are for this as part of the\n",
    "\n",
    "initial trust building exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server can request a certificate from the client and so the client must generate a pair of keys\n",
    "\n",
    "and a signed certificate from a valid CA the client then sends the certificate to the server for it\n",
    "\n",
    "to verify that the client is who they say they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you must be thinking you have never generated a client's certificate to access a Web site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's because TLS client certificates are not generally implemented on web servers even if\n",
    "\n",
    "they are it's all implemented under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in normal user don't have to generate and manage certificates manually so that was the final piece\n",
    "\n",
    "about client certificates this whole infrastructure including the CA the servers the people and the\n",
    "\n",
    "process of generating distributing and maintaining digital certificates is known as public key infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "or PKI finally let me clear up something before you leave I've been using the analogy of a key and\n",
    "\n",
    "law for private and public keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I give you the impression that only the lock or the public key can encrypt data then please forgive\n",
    "\n",
    "me as it's not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are in fact two related or paired keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can encrypt data with any one of them and only decrypt data with the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot encrypt data with one and decrypt with the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you must be careful what you encrypt your data with.\n",
    "\n",
    "If encrypted data with your private key then remember anyone with your public key which could really\n",
    "\n",
    "be anyone out there will be able to decrypt and read your message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a quick note on naming convention. Usually certificates with Public key are named crt or pem\n",
    "\n",
    "extension. So that’s server.crt,\n",
    "\n",
    "server.pem for server certificates or client.crt or client.pem for client certificates. And\n",
    "\n",
    "private keys are usually with extension .key, or –key.pem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example server.key or server-key.pem. So just remember private keys have the word ‘key’\n",
    "\n",
    "in them usually either as an extension or in the name of the certificate and one that doesn't have the\n",
    "\n",
    "word key in them is usually a public key or certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 99. TLS in Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296092#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we look at securing your Kubernetes cluster with TLS Certificates. In the previous\n",
    "\n",
    "lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw what public and private keys are how a server uses public and private keys to secure connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call them serving certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw what a certificate authority is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that the CA has its own set of public and private key pairs that it uses to sign server certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call them root certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw how a server can request a client to verify themselves using client certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "So three types of certificates several certificates configured on the servers root certificate configured\n",
    "\n",
    "on the CA servers and then client certificates configured on the clients and a quick note on naming\n",
    "\n",
    "convention before we go forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to see a lot of certificate files in this lecture and it could be very confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So use this technique to know which one is which usually certificates with public keys are named CRT\n",
    "\n",
    "or pem extension. So that’s server.crt, server.pem for server certificates or client.crt or\n",
    "\n",
    "client.pem for client certificates. And private keys are usually with extension .key, or with a –key\n",
    "\n",
    "in the filename. For example server.key or server-key.pem.\n",
    "\n",
    "So just remember private keys have the word key in them usually either as an extension or in the name\n",
    "\n",
    "of the certificate and one that doesn't have the word key in them is usually a public key or certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how I remember it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see how these concepts relate to a kubernetes cluster. The kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "or consist of a set of master and worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course all communication between these nodes need to be secure and must be encrypted all interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "between all services and their clients need to be secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example an administrator interacting with the kubernetes cluster through the kubectl utility\n",
    "\n",
    "or via accessing the kubernetes API directly must establish secure TLS connection. Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "between all the components within the kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Also need to be secured so the two primary requirements are to have all the various services within\n",
    "\n",
    "the cluster to use server certificates and all clients to use client certificates to verify they are\n",
    "\n",
    "who they say they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the different components within the kubernetes cluster and identify the various servers\n",
    "\n",
    "and clients and who talks to who.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a kube-api server as we know already the API server exposes an HTTP a service that other\n",
    "\n",
    "components as well as external users use to manage the Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is a server and it requires certificates to secure all communication with its clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we generate a certificate and key Pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call it APIserver.crt and APIsever.key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will try to stick to this naming convention going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything with a .CRT extension is the certificate and .key extension is the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember the certificate names could be different in different Kubernetes setups depending on who\n",
    "\n",
    "and how the cluster was set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these names may be different in yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will try to use names that help us easily identify the certificate files another\n",
    "\n",
    "server in the cluster is the ETCD server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ETCD server stores all information about the cluster so it requires a pair of certificate and key\n",
    "\n",
    "for itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call it at ETCD server.CRT and ETCD server.key the other server component in the\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster is on the worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are the kubelet services but also expose an HTTPs API in point that the Kubeapi server talks to\n",
    "\n",
    "to interact with the worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again that requires a certificate in keypair.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call it kubelet.crt and kublet.key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are really the server components in the Kubetnetes cluster lets now look at the client components\n",
    "\n",
    "who are the clients who access the services the clients who access the kubeapi server are us the administrators\n",
    "\n",
    "through Kubectl arrest API the admin user requires a certificate and key pair to authenticate the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server. We will call it admin.crt and admin.key. The scheduler talks to the kube-api\n",
    "\n",
    "server to look for pods that require scheduling and then get the api server to schedule the pods on\n",
    "\n",
    "the right worker nodes. The scheduler is a client that accesses the kube-api server. As far as the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server is concerned, the scheduler is just another client like the admin user. So the scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "needs to validate its identity using a client TLS certificate.So it needs its own pair of certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "and keys. We will call it scheduler.crt and scheduler.key. The kube-controller manager is another\n",
    "\n",
    "client that accesses the kube-api server. So it also requires a certificate for authentication to the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a certificate pair for it. The last client component is the kube-proxy. The kube-proxy requires\n",
    "\n",
    "a client certificate to authenticate to the kube-api server. And so it requires its own pair of certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "and keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call them kube-proxy.crt and kube-proxy.key. The servers communicate amongst them as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the kube-api server communicates with the ETCD server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact of all the components the kube-api server is the only server that talks to the ETCD server.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as far as the ETCD server is concerned the kube-api server is a client. So it needs to authenticate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubeapi server can use the same keys that it used earlier for serving its own API service. The\n",
    "\n",
    "apiserver.crt and the apiserver.key files. Or you can generate a new pair of certificates specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "for the kube-api server to authenticate to the etcd server. The kube-api server also talks to the\n",
    "\n",
    "kubelet server on each of the individual nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's how it monitors the worker nodes for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again it can use the original certificates or generate new ones specifically for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's too many certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try and group them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a set of client certificates mostly used by clients to connect to the kube-api server. And\n",
    "\n",
    "there are a set of server side certificates used by the kube-api server, etcd-server and kubelet to authenticate\n",
    "\n",
    "their clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see how to generate these certificates. As we know already\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a certificate authority to sign all of these certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes requires you to have one certificate authority for your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact you can have more than one one for all the components in the cluster and another one specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "for ETCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case the ETCD servers certificates and the ETCD servers client certificates, which in this\n",
    "\n",
    "case is the api-server client certificate will be all signed by the ETCD server CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will stick to just one CA for our cluster. The CA as we know has its own pair of certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "and key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call it ca.crt and ca.key.\n",
    "\n",
    "That should sum up all the certificates used in the cluster.\n",

    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296096#content\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we'll look at how to generate the certificates for the cluster to generate certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "there are different tools available such as easyrsa, openssl or cfssl etc or many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will use Open SSL tools to generate the certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the CA certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we create a private key using the openssl command, openssl genrsa –out ca.key.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we create a private key using the openssl command, openssl genrsa –out ca.key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we use the Open SSL requests command along with the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just created to generate a certificate signing request the certificate signing request is like a\n",
    "\n",
    "certificate with all of your details but with no signature in the certificate signing request with specified\n",
    "\n",
    "the name of the component.\n",
    "\n",
    "this certificate is for in the common name or CN field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, since we are creating a certificate for the kubernetes CA, we name it\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes-CA. Finally, we sign the certificate using the openssl x509 command and by specifying\n",
    "\n",
    "the certificate signing request we generated in the previous command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is for the CA itself, it is self-signed by the CA using its own private key that it generated\n",
    "\n",
    "in the first step. Going forward for all other certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "we will use this ca key pair to sign them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CA now has its private key and root certificate file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now look at generating the client's certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the admin user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the same process where we create a private key for the admin user using the Open SSL command.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then generate a CSR and that is where we specify the name of the admin user, which is kube-admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick note about the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "it doesn’t really have to be kube-admin.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "but remember this is the name that the kubectl client authenticates with\n",
    "\n",
    "when you run kubectl commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the audit logs and elsewhere this is the name that you will see.\n",
    "\n",
    "So provide a relevant name in this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, generate a signed certificate using the openssl x509 command.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this time, you specify the CA certificate and the CA key. You are signing your certificate with the\n",
    "\n",
    "CA key pair. That makes this a valid certificate within your cluster. The signed certificate is then output\n",
    "\n",
    "to admin.crt file. That is the certificate that the admin user will use to authenticate to kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at it, this whole process of generating a key and a certificate pair is similar to creating\n",
    "\n",
    "a user account for a new user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The certificate is the validated user I.D. and the key is like the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's just that it's much more secure than a simple user name and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is for the admin user.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you differentiate this user from any other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user account needs to be identified as an admin user and not just another basic user.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do that by adding the group details for the user in the certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case a group named SYSTEM:MASTERS exists on kubernetes with administrative privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss about groups later. But for now its important to know that you must mention this information\n",
    "\n",
    "in your certificate signing request.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by adding group details with the OU parameter while generating a signing\n",
    "\n",
    "request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it's signed we now have our certificate for the admin user with admin privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We follow the same process to generate client certificates for all other components that access the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-scheduler. Now the kube-scheduler is a system component part of the kubernetes control plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it’s name must be pre-fixed with the key word “system”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same with Kube-controller-manager. It is again a system component. So its name must be prefixed with\n",
    "\n",
    "the keyword system.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally kube-proxy. So far we have created CA certificates, then all of the client certificates including\n",
    "\n",
    "the admin user, scheduler, controller-manager, kube-proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow the same procedure to create the remaining 3 client certificates for the apiservers\n",
    "\n",
    "and kubelets\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create the service certificates for them so we will set them aside for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what do you do with these certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the admin certificate for instance to manage the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the certificate instead of a user and password in a REST API call you make to the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server. You specify the key the certificate and the ca certificate as options\n",
    "\n",
    "That's one simple way the other way is to move all of these parameters into a configuration file called\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-config.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within that specify the API server endpoint details the certificates to use etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what most of the kubernetes clients use. We will look at kube-config in depth in one of\n",
    "\n",
    "the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so we are now left with the server side certificates but before we proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember in the pre-requisite lecture we mentioned that for the clients to validate the certificate sent by\n",
    "\n",
    "the server and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "They all need a copy of the certificate authorities public certificate the one that we said is already\n",
    "\n",
    "installed within the user's browsers in case of a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in kubernetes for these various components to verify each other,\n",
    "\n",
    "they all need a copy of the CA’s root certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So whenever you configure a server or a client with certificates you will need to specify the CA\n",
    "\n",
    "root certificate as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the service side certificates now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with the ETCD server. We follow the same procedure as before to generate a certificate for\n",
    "\n",
    "ETCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will name it ETCD-SERVER. ETCD Server can be deployed as a cluster across multiple servers\n",
    "\n",
    "as in high availability environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case to secure communication between the different members in the cluster, we must generate additional\n",
    "\n",
    "peer certificates.Once the certificates are generated specify them while starting the ETCD server.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are key and cert file options where you specify the etcdserver keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other options available for specifying the peer certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally as we discussed earlier it requires the CA root certificate to verify the clients\n",
    "\n",
    "connecting to the ETCD server are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s talk about the kube-api server now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generate a certificate for the API server like before. But wait, the API server is the most popular\n",
    "\n",
    "of all components within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone talks to the kube-api server. Every operation goes through the kube-api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything moves within the cluster the API server knows about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need information you talk to the API server and so it goes by many names and aliases within the\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s real name is kube-api server. But some call it kubernetes. Because for a lot of people who don’t\n",
    "\n",
    "really know what goes under the hoods of kubernetes, the kube-api server IS kubernetes. Others like\n",
    "\n",
    "like to call it kubernetes.default.\n",
    "\n",
    "While some refer to it as kubernete.default.svc. And some like to call it by its full name,\n",
    "\n",
    "kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is also referred to, in some places, simply by its IP address. The IP address of the host running\n",
    "\n",
    "the kube-api server. Or the pod running it. So all of these names must be present in the certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "generated for the kube-api server. Only then those referring to kubernetes by these names will\n",
    "\n",
    "will be able to establish a valid connection. So we use the same set of commands as earlier to generate a\n",
    "\n",
    "key. In the certificate signing request you specify the name KUBE-APIserver. But how do you specify\n",
    "\n",
    "all the alternate names. For that\n",
    "\n",
    "you must create an openssl config file. Create an openssl.cnf file and specify the alternate names\n",
    "\n",
    "in the alt name section of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Include all the DNS names the API server goes by as well as the IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass this config file as an option while generating the certificate signing request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, sign the certificate using the CA certificate and key. You then have the kube api server certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is time to look at where we are going to specify these keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to consider the apiserver client certificates that are used by the api server while communicating\n",
    "\n",
    "as a client to the etcd and kubelet servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of these certificates are passed in to the kube-api servers executable or service configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "file.\n",
    "\n",
    "First the CA file needs to be passed in. Remember every component needs the CA certificate to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "its clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we provide the apiserver certificates under the tls-cert options. We then specify the client\n",
    "\n",
    "certificates used by the kube-api server to connect to the etcd server, again with the CA file. And finally\n",
    "\n",
    "the kube-api server client certificate to connect to the kubelets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the kubelet server. The kubelet server is an HTTPS API server that runs on each node, responsible\n",
    "\n",
    "for managing the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where the API server talks to to monitor the node as well as any information regarding what pods\n",
    "\n",
    "to schedule on this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, you need a key-certificate pair for each node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what do you need these certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are they all going to be named kubelets?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "they will be named after their nodes. Node01, node02 and node03\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the certificates are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "use them in the kubelet-config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always you specify the root CA certificate. And then provide the kubelet node certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must do this for each node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also talked about a set of client certificates that will be used by the kubelet to communicate with\n",
    "\n",
    "the kube-api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are used by the kubelet to authenticate into the kube-api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "They need to be generated as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you name these certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API server needs to know which node is authenticated and give it the right set of permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it requires the nodes to have the right names in the right format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the nodes are system components, like the kube-scheduler, and controller-manger we talked about\n",
    "\n",
    "earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "the format starts with the system keyword. Followed by node and then the node name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case node01 to node03.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how would the api server give it the right set of permissions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we specified a group name for the admin user so the admin user gets administrative privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the nodes must be added to a group named system:nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the certificates are generated they go into the kube-config files\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will see how you can view certificate information and how certificates are configured by the kubeadm\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture we see how we can view certificates in an existing\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster. So you join a new team to help them manage their kubernetes environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your new administrator to this team is being told that there are multiple issues related to certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "in the environment so you're asked to perform a health check of all the certificates in the entire cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you do first of all it's important to know how the cluster was set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different solutions available of deploying a kubernetes cluster and they use different\n",
    "\n",
    "methods to generate and manage certificates. If you were to deploy a kubernetes cluster from scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "you generate all the certificates by yourself as we did in the previous lecture or else if you were\n",
    "\n",
    "to rely on an automated provisioning tool like kubeadm, it takes care of automatically generating\n",
    "\n",
    "and configuring the cluster for you while you deploy all the components as native services on the nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "in the hard way, the kubeadm tool deploys these as PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it's important to know where to look at to view the right information in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "we are going to look at a cluster provisioned by kubeadm as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform a health check.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by identifying all the certificates used in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have created a sample Excel spreadsheet for you. Check out the resources link at the end of this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "to access it so the idea is to create a list of certificate files used their pods the names configured\n",
    "\n",
    "on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The astronaut names configured if any the organisation the certificate account belongs to the issue\n",
    "\n",
    "of the certificate and the expiration date on the certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you get these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with the certificate files used. For this, in an environment setup by kube-adm\n",
    "\n",
    "look for the kube-apiserver definition file under /etc/kubernetes/manifests folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command used to start the api server has information about all the certificates. Identify\n",
    "\n",
    "the certificate file used for each purpose and note it down next.\n",
    "\n",
    "take each certificate and look inside it to find more details about that certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we will start with the apiserver certificate file. Run the openssl x509 command\n",
    "\n",
    "and provide the certificate file as input to decode the certificate and view details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a name on the certificate under the subject section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case its kube-apiserver. Then the alternative names. The kube-api server has many,\n",
    "\n",
    "so you must ensure all of them are there and then check the validity section of the certificate to identify\n",
    "\n",
    "the expiry date and then the issuer of the certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be the CA who issued the certificate. Kubeadm\n",
    "\n",
    "names the kubernetes CA as kubernetes itself. Follow the same procedure to identify information\n",
    "\n",
    "about all the other certificates things to look for check to make sure you have the right names the\n",
    "\n",
    "right alternate names make sure the certificates are part of the correct organization and most importantly\n",
    "\n",
    "you are issued by the right issuer and that the certificates are not expired.\n",
    "\n",
    "The certificate requirements are listed in detail in the Kubernetes Documentation page. Check the\n",
    "\n",
    "references section for the link when you run into issues you want to start looking at logs if you set\n",
    "\n",
    "up the cluster from scratch by yourself and the services are configured as native services in the OS\n",
    "\n",
    "you want to start looking at the service logs using the operating systems logging functionality in case\n",
    "\n",
    "you setup the cluster with kubeadm, then the various components are deployed as PODs. So you can look\n",
    "\n",
    "at the logs using kubectl logs command followed by the pod name. Sometimes if the core components\n",
    "\n",
    "such as the kubernetes api server or the etcd server are down, the kubectl commands wont function. In that case\n",
    "\n",
    "you have to go one level down to docker to fetch the logs. List all the containers using the docker\n",
    "\n",
    "ps –a command. And then view the logs using docker logs command followed by the container ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice test and practice viewing information about existing cluster.\n",

    "the certificate back to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "She now has her own valid pair of certificate and key that she can use to access to cluster the certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "have a validated period it ends after a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time it expires we follow the same process of generating a new CSR and getting it signed by the\n",
    "\n",
    "CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we keep rotating the certificate files. So we keep talking about the CA server.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the CA serve and where is it located in the Kubernetes setup? The CA\n",
    "\n",
    "It is really just a pair of key and certificate files we have generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whoever gains access to these pair of files, can sign any certificate for the kubernetes environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can create as many users as they want but whatever privileges they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these files need to be protected and stored in a safe environment say we place them on a server that\n",
    "\n",
    "is fully secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that server becomes your CA server. The certificate key file is safely stored in that server and\n",
    "\n",
    "only on that server every time you want to sign a certificate you can only do it by logging into that\n",
    "\n",
    "server.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now we have the certificates placed on the kubernetes master node itself. So the master node\n",
    "\n",
    "is also our CA server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubeadm tool does the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It creates a CA pair of files and stores that on the master node itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been signing requests manually but as and when the users increase and your team grows\n",
    "\n",
    "you need a better automated way to manage the certificates signing requests as well as to rotate certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "when they expire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes has a built-in Certificates API that can do this for you. With the Certificates API, you now\n",
    "\n",
    "send a CertificateSigningRequest directly to kubernetes through an API call. This time, when the administrator\n",
    "\n",
    "receives a certificate signing request instead of logging onto the master node and signing the certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "by himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "he creates a Kubernetes API object called CertificateSigningRequest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the object is created all certificates any requests can be seen by administrators of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The request can be reviewed and approved easily using kubectl commands this certificate can then\n",
    "\n",
    "be extracted and shared with the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see how it is done. A user first creates a key. Then generates a certificate signing request using\n",
    "\n",
    "using the key with her name in it. Then sends the request to the administrator. The administrator takes the key\n",
    "\n",
    "and creates a certificatesigningrequest object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CertificateSigningRequest is created like any other kuberenetes object using a manifest\n",
    "\n",
    "file with the usual fields. The kind is CerificateSingingRequest. Under the spec section, specify\n",
    "\n",
    "the groups the user should be part of and list the usages of the account as a list of strings the request\n",
    "\n",
    "field is where you specify the certificate signing request sent by the user but you don't specify it\n",
    "\n",
    "as plain text instead it must be encoded using the base64 command then move the encoded text into the\n",
    "\n",
    "request field and then submit the request once the object is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "all certificate signing requests can be seen by administrators by running the kubectl get csr\n",
    "\n",
    "command. Identify the new request and approve the request by running the kubectl certificate approve\n",
    "\n",
    "command. Kubernetes signs the certificate using the CA key pairs and generates a certificate for the\n",
    "\n",
    "user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This certificate can then be extracted and shared with the user view the certificate by viewing it in\n",
    "\n",
    "a YAML format. The generate certificate is part of the output. But as before it is in a base64 encoded\n",
    "\n",
    "format to decode it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the text and use the base 64 utilities decode option.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the certificate in a plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can then be shared with the end user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen how it works let's see who does all of this for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the kubernetes control plane, you see the kube-api server, the scheduler, controller manager,\n",
    "\n",
    "etcd server etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of these components is actually responsible for all the certificate related operations all the\n",
    "\n",
    "certificate related operations are carried out by the controller manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely at the controller or manager you will see that it has controllers in it called as\n",
    "\n",
    "csr-approving, csr-signing etc that are responsible for carrying out these specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that if anyone has to sign certificates, they need the CA servers root certificate and private\n",
    "\n",
    "key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller manager service configuration has two options where you can specify this well that's\n",
    "\n",
    "for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice test and play around with the certificates API.\n",

    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296104#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at KubeConfig in Kubernetes so far we have seen how to generate a certificate for a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen how a client uses the certificate file and key to query the kubernetes Rest API for a\n",
    "\n",
    "list of pods\n",
    "\n",
    "using Curl. In this case my cluster is called my-kube-playground,\n",
    "\n",
    "so send a CURL request to the address of the kube-api server while passing in the pair of files along\n",
    "\n",
    "with the ca certificate as options.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is then validated by the API server to authenticate the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how do you do that while using the kubectl command?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify the same information using the options server, client-key, client-certificate and certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "authority with the kubectl utililty. Obviously typing those in every time is a tedious task. So you\n",
    "\n",
    "move these information to a configuration file called as KubeConfig. And then specify this file as the\n",
    "\n",
    "kubeconfig optionin your command. By default the kubectl tool looks for a file named config under\n",
    "\n",
    "a directory .kube under the users home directory. So if you create the KubeConfig file there, you\n",
    "\n",
    "don’t have to specify the path to the file explicitly in the kubectl command.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the reason you haven’t been specifying any options for your kubectl commands so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubeconfig file is in a specific format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at that. The config file has 3 sections. Clusters, Users and Contexts. Clusters are\n",
    "\n",
    "the various kubernetes clusters that you need access to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have multiple clusters for development environment or testing environment or prod or for different\n",
    "\n",
    "organizations or on different cloud providers etc. All those go their users are the user accounts\n",
    "\n",
    "with which you have access to these clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the admin user. A Dev User, a prod user etc. These users may have different privileges\n",
    "\n",
    "on different clusters finally contexts marry these together context define which user account will be\n",
    "\n",
    "used to access which cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could create a context named admin at production that will use the admin account to\n",
    "\n",
    "access a production cluster. Or I may want to access the cluster I have setup on Google with the devusers\n",
    "\n",
    "credentials to test deploying the application I built remember you're not creating any new users or\n",
    "\n",
    "configuring any kind of user access or authorization in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this process you're using existing users with their existing privileges and defining what user\n",
    "\n",
    "you're going to use to access what cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way you don’t have to specify the user certificates and server address in each and every kubectl\n",
    "\n",
    "command.\n",
    "\n",
    "You run.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does it fit into our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server specification in our command goes into the cluster section the admin users keys and certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "goes into the users section. You then create a context that specifies to use the MyKubeAdmin user to\n",
    "\n",
    "access the MyKubePlayground cluster. Let’s look at a real KubeConfig file\n",
    "\n",
    "now. The kubeConfig is in a YAML format.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has apiVersion set to v1. The kind is config. And then it has 3 sections\n",
    "\n",
    "as we discussed. One for clusters, one for contexts and one for users. Each of these is in an array format.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way you can specify multiple clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "users or contexts within the same file. Under clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "we add a new item for our kube-playground cluster. We name it mukubeplayground and specify the server\n",
    "\n",
    "address under the server field.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also requires the certificate of the Certificate Authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then add an entry into the users section to specify details of my kube admin user. Provide the\n",
    "\n",
    "location of the client’s certificate and key pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have now defined the cluster and the user to access the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we create an entry under the context section to link the two together we will name the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "my kube admin at my kube playground.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then specify the same name we used for a cluster and user follow the same procedure to add all\n",
    "\n",
    "the clusters you daily access the user credentials you use to access them as well as the contacts once\n",
    "\n",
    "the file is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "remember that you don’t have to create any object like you usually do for other kubernetes objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file is left as is and is read by the kubectl command and the required values are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how does kubectl know which context to chose from?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have defined three contexts here which one should it start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify the default context to use by adding a field current-context to the kubeconfig file.\n",
    "\n",
    "specify the name of the context you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case kubectl will always use the context\n",
    "\n",
    "dev-user@google to access the google clusters using the dev-user’s credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are command line options available within kubectl to view and modify the kubeconfig files.\n",
    "\n",
    "to view the current file being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "run the kubectl config view command.\n",
    "\n",
    "It lists the clusters, contexts and users as well as the current-context set. As we discussed\n",
    "\n",
    "earlier,\n",
    "\n",
    "if you do not specify which kubeconfig file to use, it ends up using the default file located in the\n",
    "\n",
    "folder .kube in users home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can specify a kubeconfig file by passing the kubeconfig option in the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will move our custom config to the home directory so this becomes our default config file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you update your current context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have been using my-kube-admin user to access my-kube-playground.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you change the context to use prod-user to access the production cluster? Run the kubectl\n",
    "\n",
    "config\n",
    "\n",
    "use-context command to change the current-context to the prod-user@production context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be seen in the current context field in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So yes the changes made by kubectl config command actually reflects in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make other changes in the file update or delete items in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "using other variations of the kubectl config command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check them out when you get time.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about name spaces for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cluster may be configured with multiple name spaces within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you configure a context to switch to a particular namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! The context section in the kubeconfig file can take additional field called namespace where you\n",
    "\n",
    "can specify a particular namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way when you switch to that context you will automatically be in a specific namespace finally a\n",
    "\n",
    "word on certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen path to certificate files mentioned in kubeconfig like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, its better to use the full path like this. But remember there is also another way to specify the\n",
    "\n",
    "certificate credentials. Let’s look at the first one for instance where we configure the path to the\n",
    "\n",
    "Certificate Authority.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the contents of the ca.crt file on the right. Instead of using the certificate-authority field and\n",
    "\n",
    "the path to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "you may optionally use the certificate-authority-data field and provide the contents of the certificate\n",
    "\n",
    "itself. But not the file as is,\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the contents to a base64 encoded format and then pass that in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if you see a file with the certificates data in the encoded format use the Base64 decode option\n",
    "\n",
    "to decode the certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice exercises section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice working with kubeconfig files and troubleshooting issues.\n",

    "## 107. Practice Test - KubeConfig\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice Test: https://kodekloud.com/courses/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests-labs/lectures/12038710\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 108. Persistent Key/Value Store\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen how to secure the ETCD key/value store using TLS certificates in the previous videos. Towards the end of this course, when we setup an actual cluster from scratch we will see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 109. API Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we head into authorization it is necessary to understand about API groups in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, what is the Kubernetes API?\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned about the Kube API server. Whatever operations we have done so far with the cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "we have been interacting with the API server one way or the other. Either through the kubectl utility\n",
    "\n",
    "or directly. Say we want to check the version, we can access the api server at the master nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "address followed by the port which is 6443 by default and the API version.\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns the version. Similarly to get the list of pods, you would access the url api/v1/pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "It returns the version. Similarly to get the list of pods, you would access the url api/v1/pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus in this lecture is about these API paths. The /version and /api. The Kubernetes API is grouped\n",
    "\n",
    "into multiple such groups based on their purpose. Such as one for apis, one for healthz, metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "and logs etc. The version API is for viewing the version of the cluster as we just saw The Matrix and\n",
    "\n",
    "healthz api are used to monitor the health of the cluster. The logs for integrating with third\n",
    "\n",
    "party logging applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we will focus on the API is responsible for the cluster of functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "These APIs are categorized into two. The core group and the named group. The core group is where all core\n",
    "\n",
    "functionality exists. Such as namespaces, pods, replication controllers, events, endpoints, nodes, bindings,\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, configmaps, secrets, services etc. The named group API is\n",
    "\n",
    "are more organized and going forward all the newer features are going to be made available to these\n",
    "\n",
    "named groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has groups under it for apps, extensions, networking, storage, authentication, authorization certificates etc. Shown\n",
    "\n",
    "here are just a few. Within apps, you have deployments, replicasets, statefulsets. within networking\n",
    "\n",
    "you have network policies certificates have these certificates sign requests that we talked about earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "in the section so the ones at the top are API groups and the ones at the bottom are resources in those\n",
    "\n",
    "groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each resource in this has a set of actions associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things that you can do with these resources such as list the deployments get information about one of\n",
    "\n",
    "these deployments create a deployment delete a deployment update a deployment watch a deployment etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are known as verbs. The Kubernetes API reference page can tell you what the API group is for each\n",
    "\n",
    "object select an object and the first section in the documentation page shows its group details .\n",
    "\n",
    "v1/core is just v1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also view these on your Kubernetes cluster. Access your kube-api server at port 6443, without\n",
    "\n",
    "any path and it will list you the available api groups. And then within the named api groups it returns\n",
    "\n",
    "all supported groups. A quick note on accessing the cluster API like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to access the API directly through curl as shown here,\n",
    "\n",
    "then you will not be allowed access except for certain APIs like version, as you have not specified\n",
    "\n",
    "any authentication mechanisms. So you have to authenticate to the API using your certificate files by passing\n",
    "\n",
    "them in the command line like this. An alternate option is to start a kubectl proxy client.The\n",
    "\n",
    "kubectl proxy command, launches a proxy service locally on port 8001 and uses credentials and\n",
    "\n",
    "certificates from your kubeconfig file to access the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way you don’t have to specify those in the curl command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can access the kubectl proxy service at port 8001 and the proxy will use the credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "from kube-config file to forward your request to the kube api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will list all available APIs at root. so hear are 2 terms that kind of sound the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kube proxy and kubectl proxy well they are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed about kube-proxy earlier in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to enable connectivity between parts and services across different nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss about kube-proxy in much more detail later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas kubectl proxy is an HTTP proxy service created by kubectl utility to access the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what to take away from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "All resources in Kubernetes are grouped into different api groups. At the top level\n",
    "\n",
    "you have core api group and named api group. Under the named api group\n",
    "\n",
    "You have one for each section under this API group.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the different resources and each resource has a set of associated actions known as verbs in\n",
    "\n",
    "the next section on authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see how we use these to allow or deny access to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that’s it for this lecture. I will see you in the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 110. Role Based Access Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296110#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we look at role-based access controls in much more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we create a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do that by creating a role object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a role definition file with the API version set to rbac.authorization.K8s.\n",
    "\n",
    "io/v1 and kind said to role.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the role developer as we are creating this role for developers and then we specify rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each rule has three sections- apiGroups, resources, and verbs. The same things that we talked about in\n",
    "\n",
    "one of the previous lectures for core group.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can leave the API group's section as blank for any other group you specify the group name the resources\n",
    "\n",
    "that we want to give developers access to our pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions that they can take are list, get, create and delete. To allow the developers to create\n",
    "\n",
    "configmaps,\n",
    "\n",
    "we add another rule to create ConfigMap.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add multiple rules for a single role like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the role using the kubectl create role command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to link the user to that role.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we create another object called RoleBinding. The role binding object links\n",
    "\n",
    "A user object to a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will name it devuser-developer-binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kind is RoleBinding.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has two sections.\n",
    "\n",

    "and role bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that roles and role bindings are namespaced meaning they are created within namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't specify in namespace they're created in the default namespace and control access within\n",
    "\n",
    "that namespace alone in one of the previous lectures we discussed about name spaces and how it helps\n",
    "\n",
    "in grouping or isolating resources like pods, deployments and services. But what about other resources\n",
    "\n",
    "like\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes? Can you group or isolate nodes within a namespace?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like can you say node 01 is part of the dev namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, those are cluster wide or cluster scoped resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "They cannot be associated to any particular namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the resources are categorized as either namespaced or cluster scoped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have seen a lot of namespaced resources throughout this course. Like pods, replicasets, and\n",
    "\n",
    "jobs, deployments, services, secrets, and in the last lecture we saw 2 new. Roles and Rolebindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "These resources are created in the namespace you specify when you create them.\n",

    "do we authorize users to cluster wide resources like nodes or persistent volumes that is where you use\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster roles and cluster role bindings cluster roles are just like roles except they are for a cluster\n",

    "\n",
    "as we did before this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources are nodes then create the cluster role.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to link the user to that cluster role.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we create another object called cluster role binding the role binding object links the user\n",

    "to the role.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will name it cluster-admin-role-binding. The kind is ClusterRoleBinding. Under subjects we specify\n",

    "\n",
    "of the cluster role we created create the role binding using the kubectl create command one thing\n",
    "\n",
    "to note before I let you go we said that cluster roles and bindings are used for clusters of resources\n",
    "\n",
    "but that is not a hard rule you can create a cluster role for namespace resources as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do that the user will have access to these resources across all name spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier when we created a role to authorize a user to access pods the user had access to the pods in\n",
    "\n",
    "a particular namespace along with cluster rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you authorize a user to access the pods the user gets access to all pods across the cluster. Kubernetes\n",

    "Here is the image or the repository name.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you say nginx, its actually nginx/nginx.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part stands for the user or account name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like if you created an account on Docker Hub yourself then the user account that you would get is the\n",
    "\n",
    "first part if you don't provide an account name here it assumes it to be the same as the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which in this case is nginx if you were to create your own account and create your own repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "or images under it then you would use a similar pattern now where are these images stored and pulled\n",
    "\n",
    "from since we have not specified the location where these images are to be pulled from.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is assumed to be on docker’s default registry – dockerhub. The dns name for which is docker.io.\n",
    "\n",
    "The registry is where all the images are stored whenever you create a new image or update an existing\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on network policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us first get our networking and security basics right.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I'm sorry if this is too basic but I just wanted to spend a minute on this to make sure we are all\n",
    "\n",
    "on the same page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin we will start with a simple example of a traffic flowing through a web app and database\n",
    "\n",
    "server so you have a web server serving front-end to users an app server serving back-end API and\n",
    "\n",
    "a database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user sent in a request to the web server at port 80 the web server then sent a request to the API\n",
    "\n",
    "server at port 5000 in the back end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API server then fetches data from the database server at Port 3306 and then sends the data back\n",
    "\n",
    "to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple setup so there are two types of traffic here ingress and egress.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example for a web server the incoming traffic from the users is an ingress traffic and the outgoing\n",
    "\n",
    "request to the app server is a egress traffic and that is denoted by the straight arrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define ingress and egress remember you're only looking at the direction in which the traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "originated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response back to the user denoted by the dotted lines do not really matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly in case of the back end API server it receives ingress traffic from the web server on port\n",
    "\n",
    "5000 and has egress traffic to port 3306 to the database server and from the database\n",
    "\n",
    "servers perspective it receives ingress traffic on 3306 from the API server.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to list the rules required to get this working we would have an ingress rule that is required\n",
    "\n",
    "to accept HTTP traffic on port 80 on the web server. An Egress rule to allow traffic from the web server\n",
    "\n",
    "to port 5000 on the API server. An ingress rule to accept traffic on port 5000 on the API server and\n",
    "\n",
    "an egress rule to allow traffic to port 3306 on the database server.\n",
    "\n",
    ". And finally an ingress rule on the database server to accept traffic on port 3306.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the basic of traffic flow and rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now look at Network Security in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a cluster with a set of nodes hosting a set of pods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node has an IP address and so does each pod as well as service. One of the pre-requisite for networking\n",
    "\n",
    "in kubernetes, is whatever solution you implement, the pods should be able to communicate with\n",
    "\n",
    "each other without having to configure any additional settings like routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in this network solution, all pods are on a virtual private network that spans across\n",
    "\n",
    "the nodes in the kubernetes cluster. And they can all by default reach each other using the IPs\n",
    "\n",
    "or pod names or services configured for that purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes is configured by default with an “All Allow” rule that allows traffic from any pod to any other\n",
    "\n",
    "pod or services. Let us now bring back our earlier discussion and see how it fits\n",
    "\n",
    "in to kubernetes. For each component in the application we deploy a POD. One for the front-end web server,\n",
    "\n",
    "for the API server and one for the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create services to enable communication between the PODs as well as to the end user. Based on what\n",
    "\n",
    "we discussed in the previous slide, by default all the three PODs can communicate with each other within\n",
    "\n",
    "the kubernetes cluster. What if we do not want the front-end web server to be able to communicate with\n",
    "\n",
    "the database server directly say for example your security teams and audits require you to prevent that\n",
    "\n",
    "from happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where you would implement a Network Policy to allow traffic to the db server only from the api\n",
    "\n",
    "server. A Network policy is another object in the kubernetes namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like PODs, ReplicaSets or Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "You link a network policy to one or more pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define rules within the network policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case I would say, only allow Ingress Traffic from the API Pod on Port 3306.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this policy is created, it blocks all other traffic to the Pod and only allows traffic that matches\n",
    "\n",
    "the specified rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this is only applicable to the Pod on which the network policy is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you apply or link a network policy to a pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the same technique that was used before to link ReplicaSets or Services to Pods. Labels and Selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We label the Pod and use the same labels on the pod selector field in the network policy. And then\n",
    "\n",
    "we build our rule under policy types specify whether the rule is to allow ingress or egress traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we only want to allow ingress traffic to the db-pod. So we add Ingress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we specify the ingress rule, that allows traffic from the API pod. And you specify the api pod, again\n",
    "\n",
    "using labels and selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally the port to allow traffic on, which is 3306.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us put all that together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a blank object definition file and as usual we have apiVersion, kind,\n",
    "\n",
    "metadata and spec. The apiVersion is networking.k8s.io/v1,\n",
    "\n",
    "the kind is NetworkPolicy. We will name the policy db-policy. And then under the spec section,\n",
    "\n",
    "we will first move the pod selector to apply this policy to the db pod. Then we will move the rule\n",
    "\n",
    "we created in the previous slide under it and that's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have our first network policy ready. Run the kubectl create command to create the policy. Remember\n",
    "\n",
    "that Network Policies are enforced by the Network Solution implemented on the Kubernetes Cluster. And not\n",
    "\n",
    "all network solutions support network policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few of them that are supported are kube-router, Calico, Romana and Weave-net.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you used Flannel as the networking solution, it does not support network policies\n",
    "\n",
    "as of this recording. Always refer to the network solution’s documentation to see support for network\n",
    "\n",
    "policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember even in a cluster configured with a solution that does not support network policies you\n",
    "\n",
    "can still create the policies but they will just not be enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will not get an error message saying the network solution does not support network policies.\n",
