    "Hello and welcome to this section on Networking in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad Mannambeth and we are going through the certified Kubernetes administrators course in this\n",
    "\n",
    "section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on the networking concepts some networking basics are required to get through this section\n",
    "\n",
    "such as the basics about setting and checking IP addresses on any given system knowledge on gateways\n",
    "\n",
    "and roads and knowledge about DNS and configuring DNS servers etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "While working on this section as before we send out a poll asking about your knowledge and networking\n",
    "\n",
    "based on your feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've created some prerequisite lectures around configuring interfaces and IP addresses configuring\n",
    "\n",
    "gateways and routes basics of named resolution DNS configuration on Linux systems as well as how to\n",
    "\n",
    "get started with one of the DNS solutions core DNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are short lectures that should give you enough knowledge to go through the remainder of the section.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to know a little bit about a network name spaces and how Docker uses network name\n",
    "\n",
    "spaces internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again as always these are for beginners and are optional lectures and depending on your knowledge feel\n",
    "\n",
    "free to go through only those that you think you really need.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would highly recommend the network name spaces and docker networking lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are done with the prerequisite lectures we start with networking in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again I'm going to rearrange the topics a little bit to improve the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by looking at the cluster networking needs and then followed by POD networking concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at CNI in Kubernetes and how CNI can help solve the POD networking challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we pick up from where we left off in the prerequisite lectures around network name spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue to discuss cluster DNS and how Kubernetes implements DNS internally within finish with ingress\n",
    "\n",
    "networking.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this series of lectures, we get our networking basics right.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at basic networking concepts like Switching, Routing, Gateways etc. We then understand DNS, and\n",
    "\n",
    "then we get a basic introduction to core DNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at how to configure DNS settings on a Linux system within understand basics of network namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "in Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am not going to bore you with theories on OSI models or network layers\n",
    "\n",
    "We're just brushing up enough networking to understand the rest of the section in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we don't just go through the concepts we see how these are configured on our systems specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "from a Linux perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are going to be lots of commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at this from a system admins and the application developers perspective and not necessarily\n",
    "\n",
    "from a network engineers that way later on when we discuss these in the context of our course.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know what we were talking about where to look for information where things are configured how to\n",
    "\n",
    "troubleshoot etc. And of course as always if these seem to be too basic for you if you or if you're\n",
    "\n",
    "already good with networking in Linux feel free to skip these lectures and go straight to the ones on\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a\n",
    "\n",
    "Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two computers A & B – laptops, desktops, VMs on the cloud, wherever.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does system A reach B?\n",
    "\n",
    "We connect them to a switch, and the switch creates a network containing the two systems. To connect\n",
    "\n",
    "them to a switch\n",
    "\n",
    "we need an interface on each host. Physical or virtual depending on the host to see the interfaces for\n",
    "\n",
    "the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the IP link command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we look at the interface named eth0 that we will be using to connect to the switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume it's a network with the address.\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then assign the systems with IP addresses on the same network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we use the command ip addr. Once the links are up, and the IP addresses are assigned,\n",
    "\n",
    "The computers can now communicate with each other through the switch the switch can only enable communication\n",
    "\n",
    "within and network which means it can receive packets from a host on the network and deliver it to other\n",
    "\n",
    "systems within the same network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have another network containing systems C & D at address 192.168.2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Systems have IP address 192.168.2.10 and 2.11 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a system in one network reach a system in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does System B with the IP 192.168.1.11 reach system C with the IP 2.10 on the\n",
    "\n",
    "other network.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where a Router comes in. A Router helps connect two networks together. It is an intelligent device,\n",
    "\n",
    "so think of it as another server with many network ports. Since it connects to the two separate networks,\n",
    "\n",
    "it gets two IPs assigned. One on each network. In the first network\n",
    "\n",
    "we assign it an IP address 192.168.1.1 and in the second we assign it an IP 192.168.2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a router connected to the two networks that can enable communication between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when system B tries to send a packet to system C, how does it know where the router is on the network\n",
    "\n",
    "to send the packet through the router is just another device on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "there could be many other such devices. That’s where we configure the systems with a gateway or a route.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the network was a room, the gateway is a door to the outside world to other networks or to the\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The systems need to know where that door is to go through that to see the existing routing configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "on a system run the route command. It displays the kernels routing table and within that, as you can\n",
    "\n",
    "see there are no routing configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "as of now.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this condition your system B will not be able to reach system C it can only reach other systems\n",
    "\n",
    "within the same network in the range 192.168.1.0. To configure a gateway on system B to reach the\n",
    "\n",
    "systems on network 192.168.2.0, run the ip route add command, and specify that you can reach the\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.2.0 network through the door or gateway at 192.168.1.11. Running the route\n",
    "\n",
    "command again shows that we have a route added to reach the 192.168.2.0 series network through the\n",
    "\n",
    "router.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember this has to be configured on all the systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the system C is to send a packet to system B, then you need to add a route on system C’s\n",
    "\n",
    "routing table to access network 192.168.1.0 through the router configured with the IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.2.1. Now suppose these systems need access to the Internet. Say they need access to Google at\n",
    "\n",
    "172.217.194.0 network on the internet. So you connect the router to the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "and then add a new road in your routing table to road all traffic to the network 172.217.194\n",
    "\n",
    "through your router there are so many different sites on different networks on the Internet instead\n",
    "\n",
    "of adding a routing table entry for these same routers IP address for each of those networks you can\n",
    "\n",
    "simply say for any network that you don't know a route to use this router as the default gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way any request to any network outside of your existing network goes to this particular router.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a simple setup like this, all you need is a single routing table entry with a default gateway set\n",
    "\n",
    "to the routers IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember instead of the word default you could also say 0.0.0.0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "It means any IP destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these lines mean the same thing. A 0.0.0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Entry in the Gateway field indicates that you don't need a gateway for example in this case for system\n",
    "\n",
    "C to access any devices in the 192.168.2.0 network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't need a gateway because it is in its own network. But say you have multiple routers in your\n",
    "\n",
    "network one for the Internet another for the internal private network then you will need to have two\n",
    "\n",
    "separate entries for each network.\n",
    "\n",
    "One entry for the internal private network and another entry with the default gateway for all other\n",
    "\n",
    "networks including public networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are having issues reaching internet from your systems,\n",
    "\n",
    "This routing table and the default gateway configuration is a good place to start let us know look at\n",
    "\n",
    "how we can set up a linux host as a rotor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have 3 hosts A, B and C. A & B are connected to a network 192.168.1 and B\n",
    "\n",
    "& C to another on 192.168.2. So host B is connected to both the networks using two interfaces eth0\n",
    "\n",
    "A has IP 192.168.1.5, C has 192.168.2.5 and B has an IP on both the networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.1.6 and 192.168.2.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we get A to talk to C? Basically,\n",
    "\n",
    "if I try to ping 192.168.2.5 from A, it would say Network is Unreachable. And by now we know why that is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Host A has no idea how to reach a network at 192.168.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to tell host A that the door or gateway to network 2 is through host B. And we do that by adding\n",
    "\n",
    "adding a routing table entry. We add a route to access network 192.168.2 via the gateway\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.1.6. If the packets where to get through to Host C, Host C will have to send back responses\n",
    "\n",
    "to Host A. When Host C tries to reach Host A at 192.168.1 network, it would face the same issue. So\n",
    "\n",
    "we need to let know Host C know that it can reach Host A through Host B which is acting as a router. So we\n",
    "\n",
    "add a similar entry into Host C’s routing table. This time we say to reach network 192.168.1.0,\n",
    "\n",
    "talk to Host B at 192.168.2.6. When we try to ping now, we no longer get the Network Unreachable\n",
    "\n",
    "error message that means our routing entries are right but we still don't get any response back. By default\n",
    "\n",
    "in Linux, packets are not forwarded from one interface to the next for example packets received on eth0\n",
    "\n",
    "on host, B are not forwarded to elsewhere through eth 1 this is this way for security reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you had eth0 connected to your private network and eth1 to a public network, we\n",
    "\n",
    "don't want anyone from the public network to easily send messages to the private network unless you\n",
    "\n",
    "explicitly allow that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in this case since we know that both are private networks and it is safe to enable communication\n",
    "\n",
    "between them we can allow host B to forward packets from one network to the other whether a host can\n",
    "\n",
    "forward packets between interfaces is governed by a setting in this system at file /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip\n",
    "\n",
    "forward by default, the value in this file is set to 0 meaning no forward set\n",
    "\n",
    "this to 1 and you should see the pings go through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember simply setting this value does not persist the changes across reboots for that you must\n",
    "\n",
    "modify the same value in the /etc/sysctl.conf file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's take away some key commands from this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "These will be handy in the upcoming lectures IP link is to list and modify interfaces on the host\n",
    "\n",
    "ip addr command is to see the ip addresses assigned to those interfaces ip addr add command is used to set\n",
    "\n",
    "IP addresses on the interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember changed made using these commands are only valid till a restart. If you want to persist these\n",
    "\n",
    "changes you must set them in the /etc/network/interfaces file. ip route or simply the route command\n",
    "\n",
    "is used to view the routing table. And ip route add command is used to add entries into the routing table.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally remember the command to check if IP forwarding is enabled on a host.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working with a house configured as a router Well that's it for this lecture in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss about DNS configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 136. Prerequisite - DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296140#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, we get introduced to DNS in Linux for the absolute beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss the basic concepts and view some commands that will help us explore DNS configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "on hosts specifically Linux source.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two computers A & B. Both part of the same network and they have been assigned with IP addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.1.10 and 1.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are able to ping one computer from the other using the other computers IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that system B has database services on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of having to remember the IP address of the system B, you decide to give it a name db.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward you would like to ping system B using the name db instead of its IP address if you tried\n",
    "\n",
    "to ping db now, you would see that host it is unaware of a host named db.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you fix that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, you want to tell system A, that system B at IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.1.11\n",
    "\n",
    "has a name db. You want to tell system A that when I say db I mean the IP 192.18.1.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "has a name db. You want to tell system A that when I say db I mean the IP 192.18.1.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do that by adding an entry into the /etc/hosts file on system A. Mention the IP address and the\n",
    "\n",
    "name you want your host to see system B. As we told system A that the IP at 192.168.1.11\n",
    "\n",
    "is a host named db pings to db. now get sent to the correct IP and are successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is an important point to note here with all system a that the IP at 192.168.1.11\n",
    "\n",
    "is a host named db. Host A takes that for granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever we put in the /etc/hosts file is the source of truth for Host A But that need not be the truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Host A does not check to make sure if system B’s actual name is db. For instance, running a hostname command\n",
    "\n",
    "on system B reveals that it is named host-2. But host A doesn’t care.\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes by what's in the hosts file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even fool system A to believing that system B is Google just an entry into the host file with\n",
    "\n",
    "an IP mapping to www.google.com. Then ping google and you will get a response from system B.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have two names pointing to the same system. One as db and another as google. And we can use either\n",
    "\n",
    "names to reach system B.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have as many names as you want for as many servers as you want in the etc hosts file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime we reference another host by its name, from Host A, through a ping command or ssh command\n",
    "\n",
    "or through any of the applications or tools within this system, it looks into its /etc/hosts file to find\n",
    "\n",
    "out the IP address of that host translating hostname to IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way is known as name resolution within a small network of few systems you can easily get away with\n",
    "\n",
    "the entries in the /etc/hosts file. On each system\n",
    "\n",
    "I specify which are the other systems in the environment. And that’s how it was done in the past. Until\n",
    "\n",
    "the environment grew and these files got filled with too many entries and managing these became too\n",
    "\n",
    "hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one of the servers IP changed you would need to modify the entries in all of these hosts and that's\n",
    "\n",
    "where we decided to move all these entries into a single server who will manage it centrally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call that our DNS server and then we point all host to look up that server if they need to resolve\n",
    "\n",
    "the hostname to an IP address instead of its own /etc/hosts files.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we point our host to a DNS server? Our DNS server has the IP 192.168.1.100. Every host has\n",
    "\n",
    "a DNS resolution configuration file at /etc/resolv.conf.\n",
    "\n",
    "you add an entry into it specifying the address of the DNS server. We say nameserver and point it\n",
    "\n",
    "to 192.168.1.100\n",
    "\n",
    "And that should be it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this is configured on all of your host every time a host comes up across a hostname that it does\n",
    "\n",
    "not know about it looks it up from the DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the IP of any of the host was to change it simply update the DNS server and all host should resolve\n",
    "\n",
    "the new IP address going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "You no longer need any entries in the /etc/hosts file in any of the hosts. But that does not mean you can’t\n",
    "\n",
    "have entries in host file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You still can for example say you were to provision a test server for your own needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't think others would need to resolve the server by its name so it need not be added to the DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case you can add an entry into your host at C host file to resolve the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now resolve the server however no other system will be able to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a system is able to use hostname to IP mapping from the /etc/hosts file locally as well as from a remote\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you have an entry in both places? One in your /etc/hosts file and another in DNS?\n",
    "\n",
    "I have an entry in my local file set to 192.168.1.115 and someone added an entry for the same\n",
    "\n",
    "host to 192.168.1.116 on the DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the host first looks in the local /etc/hosts file and then looks at the nameserver.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if it finds the entry in the local /etc/hosts file it uses that,\n",
    "\n",
    "if not it looks for that host in the DNS server. But that order can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order is defined by an entry in the file at the end as switch dot account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The line with the host entry as you can see the order is first files and then followed by DNS files\n",
    "\n",
    "refers to the host file and DNS refers to the DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for every hostname the host first looks into the SC hosts file and if it cannot find it there it\n",
    "\n",
    "then looks at the DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "This order can be modified by editing this entry in the file as per this order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our host would resolve the test server to 1 only to 168 1 1 1 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you tried to ping a server that is not in either list for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "I try and ping w w w Facebook dot com.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't have facebook dot com in my etsy House file and then I don't have it in my DNS server either.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in that case it will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add another entry into a resolved dot com file to point to a name server that knows Facebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a dot dot dot aid is a common well public.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture we saw why you need a DNS server and how it can help manage name resolution in large environments with many hostnames and Ips and how you can configure your hosts to point to a DNS server. In this article we will see how to configure a host as a DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a server dedicated as the DNS server, and a set of Ips to configure as entries in the server. There are many DNS server solutions out there, in this lecture we will focus on a particular one – CoreDNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you get core dns? CoreDNS binaries can be downloaded from their Github releases page or as a docker image. Let’s go the traditional route. Download the binary using curl or wget. And extract it. You get the coredns executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the executable to start a DNS server. It by default listens on port 53, which is the default port for a DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we haven’t specified the IP to hostname mappings. For that you need to provide some configurations. There are multiple ways to do that. We will look at one. First we put all of the entries into the DNS servers /etc/hosts file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we configure CoreDNS to use that file. CoreDNS loads it’s configuration from a file named Corefile. Here is a simple configuration that instructs CoreDNS to fetch the IP to hostname mappings from the file /etc/hosts. When the DNS server is run, it now picks the Ips and names from the /etc/hosts file on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this video, we get introduced to network namespace in Linux at the end of this section\n",
    "\n",
    "we will go through a practice test where you are given a set of challenges related to network namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "and you would practice solving them on a live practical hands-on lab environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well before we get started don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more videos like this. Network\n",
    "\n",
    "namespaces are used by containers like Docker to implement network isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a simple host. As we know already containers are separated from the underlying host\n",
    "\n",
    "using namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are our namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your host was your house then namespaces are rooms within the house that you assign to each\n",
    "\n",
    "of your children.\n",
    "\n",
    "The room helps in providing privacy to each child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each child can only see what's within his or her room.\n",
    "\n",
    "They cannot see what happens outside their room as far as they're concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're the only person living in the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as a parent you have visibility into all the rooms in the House as well as other areas of the\n",
    "\n",
    "house.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish you can establish connectivity between two rooms in the house.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a container you want to make sure that it is isolated that it does not see any other\n",
    "\n",
    "processes on the host or any other containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a special room for it on our host using an namespace as far as the container is concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "It only sees the processes run by it and thinks that it is on its own host.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying host however has visibility into all of the processes including those running inside\n",
    "\n",
    "the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be seen when you list the processes from within the container you see a single process with\n",
    "\n",
    "the process ID of 1. When you list the same processes as a root user from the underlying host,\n",
    "\n",
    "You see all the other processes along with the process running inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time with a different process ID. It’s the same process running with different process ideas inside\n",
    "\n",
    "and outside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how namespaces works.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to networking Our host has its own interfaces that connect to the local area network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our host has its own routing and ARP table with information about rest of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to seal all of those details from the container. When the container is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a network namespace for it that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has no visibility to any network related information on the host. Within its namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "the container can have its own virtual interfaces routing and ARP tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The container has its own interface to create a new network namespace on a Linux host run the\n",
    "\n",
    "ip nets add command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we create two network namespaces to list the network namespaces run the ip netns\n",
    "\n",
    "command to list the interfaces on my host.\n",
    "\n",
    "I run the ip link command I see that my host has to look back interface and eth0 interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how do we view the same within the network namespace that we created?\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we run the same command within the red or blue namespace? Pre-fix the command with the command\n",
    "\n",
    "ip netns exec followed by the namespace name which is read now the IP link command will be executed inside\n",
    "\n",
    "ip netns exec followed by the namespace name which is read now the IP link command will be executed inside\n",
    "\n",
    "the red namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to do it is to add the dash and option to the original IP link comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one is simpler but remember this only works if you intend to run the ip command inside the\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see it only lists the loopback interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot see the eth0 interface on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with namespace as we have successfully prevented the container from seeing the hosts interface. The\n",
    "\n",
    "same is true with the ARP table.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the ARP command on the host, you see a list of entries. But if you run it inside the container\n",
    "\n",
    "you see no entries and the same for routing table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as of now these network namespaces have no network connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have no interfaces of their own and they cannot see the underlying hosts network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at establishing connectivity between the namespaces themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how we would connect to physical machines together using a cable to an ethernet interface\n",
    "\n",
    "on each machine, you can connect to namespaces together using a virtual Ethernet pair or a virtual cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its often referred to as a pipe. But I’d like to call it a virtual cable with two interfaces on either\n",
    "\n",
    "ends. To create the cable, run the ip link add command with the type set to veth and specify the two ends\n",
    "\n",
    "veth-red netns red to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to attach each interface to the appropriate namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the command ip link set\n",
    "\n",
    "veth-red netns\n",
    "\n",
    "Red.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly attach the blue interface to the blue namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then assign IP addresses to each of these names faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the usual ip addr command to assign the IP address but within each namespace, we will assign\n",
    "\n",
    "the red namespace IP 192.168.15.1. With an assigned a blue namespace an IP 192.168.15.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "the red namespace IP 192.168.15.1. With an assigned a blue namespace an IP 192.168.15.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then bring up the interface using the ip link set up command for each device within the respective\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace. The links are up and the namespace can now reach each other. Try a ping from the Red\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace reach the IP of the blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the ARP table on the red namespace you see it's identified its blue number at 192.168.1.2 with the MAC address.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the ARP table on the red namespace you see it's identified its blue number at 192.168.1.2 with the MAC address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if you list the ARP table on the blue namespace you see it's identified it's red neighbour.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you compare this with the ARP table of the host, you see that the host’s ARP table has no idea about\n",
    "\n",
    "this new namespace we have created. And no idea about the interfaces we created in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that worked when you had just to namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you do when you have more of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you enable all of them to communicate with each other? Just like in the physical world,\n",
    "\n",
    "you create a virtual network inside your host. To create a network you need a switch. So to create a virtual\n",
    "\n",
    "network you need a virtual switch so you create a virtual switch within our host and connect the namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do you create a virtual switch within a host?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple solutions available. Such as a native solution called as Linux Bridge and the Open vSwitch etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple solutions available. Such as a native solution called as Linux Bridge and the Open vSwitch etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use the Linux Bridge option to create an internal bridge network\n",
    "\n",
    "we add a new interface to the host using the ip link add command with the type set to bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will name it v-net-0. As far as our host is concerned\n",
    "\n",
    "it is just another interface. Just like the eth0 interface. It appears in the output of the ip link\n",
    "\n",
    "command along with the other interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s currently down so you need to turn it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the ip link set dev up command to bring it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the namespace as this interface is like a switch that it can connect to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So think of it as an interface for the host and a switch for the namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the next step is to connect the namespace to this new virtual network switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we created the cable or the eth pair with the veth-red interface on one end and blue interface\n",
    "\n",
    "on the other because we wanted to connect the two namespaces directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will be connecting all named spaces to the bridge network.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need new cables for that purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cable doesn't make sense anymore so we will get rid of it use the ip link delete command to delete\n",
    "\n",
    "the cable when you delete the link with one end the other end gets deleted automatically since they\n",
    "\n",
    "are a pair. Let us now create new cables to connect the namespace to the bridge run the ip link add\n",
    "\n",
    "command and create a pair with veth-red on one end, like before, but this time the other end will be\n",
    "\n",
    "named veth-red-br. As it connects to the bridge network.\n",
    "\n",
    "named veth-red-br. As it connects to the bridge network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This naming convention will help us easily identify the interfaces that associate to the red namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly create a cable to connect the blue namespace to the bridge network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the cables ready it's time to get them connected to the namespaces. To attach one end\n",
    "\n",
    "of this of the interface to the red namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "run the IP link set veth-red netns red command. To attach the other end to the bridge network, run\n",
    "\n",
    "the ip link set command on the veth-red-br end and specify the master for it as the v-net-0 network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the same procedure to test as the blue cable to the blue namespace and the bridge network. Let\n",
    "\n",
    "us now set IP addresses for these links and turn them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the same IP addresses that we used before, 192.168.15.1 and 192.168.15.2. And finally, turn up the devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the same IP addresses that we used before, 192.168.15.1 and 192.168.15.2. And finally, turn up the devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The containers can now reach each other over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we follow the same procedure to connect the remaining two namespaces to the same network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have all 4 namespaces connected to our internal branch network and they can all communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have all IP addresses 192.168.15.1, 2, 3 and 4.\n",

    "Would it work? No.\n",

    "\n",
    "namespaces through it. Run the ip addr command to set the IP 192.168.15.5\n",
    "\n",
    "To this interface we can now pin the red namespace from our local host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember this entire network is still private and restricted within the host from within the namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "you can’t reach the outside world, nor can anyone from the outside world reach the services or\n",
    "\n",
    "applications hosted inside the only door to the outside world is the Internet port on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we configure this bridge to reach the Lan network through the Ethernet port.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say there is another host attached to our LAN network with the address 192.168.1.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can I reach this host from within my namespaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if I try to ping this host from my blue namespace? The blue namespace sees that I am trying\n",
    "\n",
    "to reach a network at 192.168.1 which is different from my current network of\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.15. So it looks at its routing table to see how to find that network. The routing table has\n",
    "\n",
    "no information about other network so it comes back saying that the network is unreachable so we need\n",
    "\n",
    "to add an entry into the routing table to provide a gateway or door to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we find that gateway? A door or gateway,\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed before is a system on the local network that connects to the other network.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a system that has one interface on the network local to the blue namespace, which is the\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.15 network and is also connected to the outside LAN network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a logical view.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the local hosts that have all these namespaces on. So you can ping the namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember our local host has an interface to attach the private network so you can ping the namespaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "So our local host is the gateway that connects the two networks together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now add a route entry in the blue namespace to say route all traffic to the 192.168.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "network through the gateway at 192.168.15.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember our host has two IP addresses, one on the bridge network at 192.168.15.5 and\n",
    "\n",
    "another on the external network at 192.168.1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "another on the external network at 192.168.1.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you use any in the route?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, because the blue namespace can only reach the gateway in its local network at 192.168.15.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, because the blue namespace can only reach the gateway in its local network at 192.168.15.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default gateway should be reachable from your namespace when you add it to your route. When you try\n",
    "\n",
    "to\n",
    "\n",
    "ping now you no longer get the Network unreachable message.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you still don’t get any response back from the ping. What might be the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about a similar situation in one of our earlier lectures where from our home network we tried\n",
    "\n",
    "reach the external internet through our router. Our home network has our internal private IP addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "that the destination network don't know about so they cannot reach back. For this.\n",
    "\n",
    "we need NAT enabled on our host acting as the gateway here so that it can send the messages to the Lan\n",
    "\n",
    "in its own name with its own address.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we add NAT functionality to our host?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should do that using IP tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a new rule in the NAT IP table in the POSTROUTING chain to masquerade or replace the from address\n",
    "\n",
    "on all packets coming from the source network 192.168.15.0 with its own IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way anyone receiving these packets outside the network will think that they are coming from the\n",
    "\n",
    "host and not from within the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we try to ping now, we see that we are able to reach the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, say the LAN is connected to the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the namespaces to reach the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we try to ping a server on the internet at 8.8.8.8 from the blue namespace. We receive\n",
    "\n",
    "a familiar message that the Network is unreachable. By now we know why that is. We look at the routing table\n",
    "\n",
    "and see that we have routes to the network 192.168.1, but not to anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these name spaces can reach any network our host can reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simply say that to reach any external network\n",
    "\n",
    "talk to our host.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we add a default gateway specifying our host.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should now be able to reach the outside world from within these namespaces us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what about connectivity from the outside world to inside the namespaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example the blue namespace hosted a Web application on port 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now the name spaces are on an internal private network and no one from the outside world knows\n",
    "\n",
    "about that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can only access these from the host itself if you try to ping the private IP of the namespace from\n",
    "\n",
    "another host on another network.\n",
    "\n",
    "you will see that it’s not reachable. Obviously, because that host doesn’t know about this private network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make that communication possible you have two options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two options that we saw in the previous lecture on NAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is to give away the identity of the private network to the second host.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we basically add a route entry to the second host telling that host that the network 192.168.15\n",
    "\n",
    "can be reached through the host at 192.168.1.2. But we don’t want to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other option is to add a port forwarding rule using IP tables to say any traffic coming to port\n",
    "\n",
    "80 on the local host is to be forwarded to port 80 on the IP assigned to the blue namespace.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we look at networking in Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a basic networking options in Docker and then try and related to the concepts around\n",
    "\n",
    "networking name spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with a single Docker Host. A server with Docker installed on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has an ethernet interface at eth0 that connects to the local network with the IP address 192.168.1.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has an ethernet interface at eth0 that connects to the local network with the IP address 192.168.1.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a container you have different networking options to choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s see the none network. With the None network,\n",
    "\n",
    "the docker container is not attached to any network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The container cannot reach the outside world and no one from the outside world can reach the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run multiple containers they are all created without being part of any network and cannot talk\n",
    "\n",
    "to each other or to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is the Host network. With the host network,\n",
    "\n",
    "the container is attached to the host’s network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no network isolation between the host and the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deploy a web application listening on port 80 in the container then the web application is available\n",
    "\n",
    "on port 80 on the host without having to do any additional port mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to run another instance of the same container that listens on the same port it won't work\n",
    "\n",
    "as they share hosts networking and two processes cannot listen on the same port at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third networking option is the bridge. In this case, an internal private network is created which\n",
    "\n",
    "the docker host and containers attach to. The network has an address 172.17.0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "by default and each device connecting to this network get their own internal private network address\n",
    "\n",
    "on this network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the network that we are most interested in. So we will take a deeper look at how exactly docker\n",
    "\n",
    "creates and manages this network.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Docker is installed on the host it creates an internal private network called bridge by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this when you run the docker network\n",
    "\n",
    "ls command. Now, docker calls the network by the name “bridge”. But on the host the network is created\n",
    "\n",
    "by the name docker 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this in the output of the ip link command. Docker internally uses a technique similar to\n",
    "\n",
    "what we saw in the video on namespaces by running the IP link\n",
    "\n",
    "add command with the type set to bridge. So remember, the name bridge in the docket network ls output\n",
    "\n",
    "refers to the name docker 0 on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are one and the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the interface or network is currently down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, remember we said that the bridge network is like an interface to the host, but a switch to the\n",
    "\n",
    "namespaces or containers within the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the interface docker0 on the host is assigned an IP 172.17.0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this in the output of the ip addr command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a container is created Docker creates a network namespace for it just like how we created\n",
    "\n",
    "network\n",
    "\n",
    "namespaces in the previous video. Run the ip netns command to list the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a minor hack to be done to get the ip netns command to list the namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "created by Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Checkout the resources section of this lecture for information on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The namespace has the name starting b3165.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the namespace associated with each container in the output of the docker inspect comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does docker attach the container or its network namespace to the bridge network? For the remainder\n",
    "\n",
    "of this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "container and network namespace mean the same thing. When I say container\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm referring to the network namespace created by Docker for that container.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does docker attach the container to the bridge? As we did before\n",
    "\n",
    "it creates a cable, a VIRTUAL cable, with two interfaces on each end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find out what Docker has created here.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the ip link command on the docker host you see one end of the interface which is attached to\n",
    "\n",
    "the local bridge Docker zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the same command again this time with the –n option with the namespace, then it lists\n",
    "\n",
    "the other end of the interface within the container namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface also gets an IP assigned within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view this by running the ip addr command but within the container's namespace. The container\n",
    "\n",
    "gets assigned 172.17.0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also view this by attaching to the container and looking at the IP address assigned to it that\n",
    "\n",
    "way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same procedure is followed every time a new container is created. Docker creates a namespace. Creates\n",
    "\n",
    "a pair of interfaces. Attaches one end to the container and another end to the present. The interface\n",
    "\n",
    "pairs can be identified using their numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odd and even former pair 9 and 10 are one pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "7 and 8 are another and 11 and 12 are one pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The containers are all part of the network now they can all communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at port mapping now. The container we created is nginx, so it’s a web application serving\n",
    "\n",
    "web page on port 80. Since our container is within a private network inside the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only other containers in the same network or the host itself can access this Web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tried to access the web page using curl with the IP of the container from within Docker host\n",
    "\n",
    "on port 80 you will see the web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to do the same thing outside the host, you cannot view the web page. To allow external users\n",
    "\n",
    "to access the applications hosted on containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides a port publishing or port mapping option. When you run containers\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell Docker to map port 8080 on the Docker host to port 80 on the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that done, you could access the web application using the IP of the docker host and port 8080.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any traffic to port 8080 on the docker host will be forwarded to port 80 on the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all of your external users and other applications or service can use this Url to access the application\n",
    "\n",
    "deployed on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does docker do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it forward traffic from one port to another?\n",
    "\n",
    "What would you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's forget about Docker and everything else for a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirement is to forward traffic coming in on one port to another port on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about it in one of our prerequisite lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a NAT rule for that. Using iptables we create an entry into the NAT table, to append a rule\n",
    "\n",
    "to the PREROUTING chain to change the destination port from 8080 to 80. Docker does it the same way. Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "adds the rule to the docker chain and sets destination to include the containers IP as well you can\n",
    "\n",
    "see the rule docker creates when you list the rules in iptables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture in the next lecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at Container networking interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we saw how network namespace work as in how to create an isolated network namespace environment\n",
    "\n",
    "within our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "we saw how to connect multiple such namespaces through a bridge network,\n",
    "\n",
    "how to create Virtual cables, or pipes with virtual interfaces on either end, and then how to attach each\n",
    "\n",
    "end to a namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "and the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then saw how to assign ip and bring them up. And finally enable NAT or IP Masquerade for external\n",
    "\n",
    "communication etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then saw how Docker did it for its bridge networking option.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was pretty much the same way except that it uses different naming patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well other container solutions solve the networking challenges in kind of the same way like rocket or\n",
    "\n",
    "Mesos Containerizer or any other solutions that work with containers and requires to configure networking\n",
    "\n",
    "between them like Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are all solving the same networking challenges, by researching and finally identifying a\n",
    "\n",
    "similar approach with our own little minor differences why code and develop the same solution multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "times?\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not just create a single standard approach that everyone can follow?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we take all of these ideas from the different solutions and move all the networking portions of it\n",
    "\n",
    "into a single program or code\n",
    "\n",
    "And since this is for the bridge network we call it bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we created a program or a script that performs all the required tasks to get the container attached\n",
    "\n",
    "to a bridge network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could run this program using its name bridge and specify that you want to add this container\n",
    "\n",
    "to a particular network namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bridge program takes care of the rest so that the container runtime environments are relieved of\n",
    "\n",
    "those tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, whenever rkt or kubernetes creates a new container, they call the bridge plugin and pass the\n",
    "\n",
    "container id and namespace to get networking configured for that container.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what if you wanted to create such a program for yourself? May be for a new networking type. If you where\n",
    "\n",
    "doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "What arguments and commands should it support.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you make sure the program you create will work correctly with these run times.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you know container run times like kubernetes or rkt will invoke your program correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where we need some standards defined. A standard that defines , how a programe should look, how container\n",
    "\n",
    "runtime will invoke them so that everyone can adhere to a single set of standards and develop solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "that work across runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where container network interface comes in. The CNI is a set of standards that define how programs\n",
    "\n",
    "should be developed to solve networking challenges in a container runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programs are referred to as plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case bridge program that we have been referring to is a plugin for CNI. CNI defines how the\n",
    "\n",
    "plugin should be developed and how container run times should invoke them. CNI defines a set of responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "for container run times and plugin. For container runtimes\n",
    "\n",
    "CNI specifies that it is responsible for creating a network namespace for each container.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should then identify the networks the container must attach to container runtime must then invoke\n",
    "\n",
    "the plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a container is created using the ADD command and also invoke the plugin when the container is deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "using the Del command. It also specifies how to configure in network plugin on the container runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "using a JSON file. On the plugin side, it defines that the plugin should support Add, Del and check command\n",
    "\n",
    "line arguments and that these should accept parameters like container and network namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plugin should take care of assigning IP addresses to the PODs and any associated routes required\n",
    "\n",
    "for the containers to reach other containers in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end the results should be specified in a particular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as the container runtime and plugins adhere to these standards they can all live together\n",
    "\n",
    "in harmony.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any runtime should be able to work with any plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNI comes with a set of supported plugins already. Such as bridge, VLAN, IPVLAN, MACVLAN, one for windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as IPAM plugins like host-local and dhcp.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other plugins available from third party organizations as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples are weave, flannel, cilium, Vmware NSX, Calico, Infoblox etc. All of these container runtimes\n",
    "\n",
    "implement CNI standards. So any of them can work with any of these plugins. But there is one that is not\n",
    "\n",
    "in this list. Docker does not implement CNI. Docker has its own set of standards known as CNM which\n",
    "\n",
    "stands for Container Network Model which is another standard that aims at solving container networking\n",
    "\n",
    "challenges similar to CNI\n",
    "\n",
    "but with some differences. Due to the differences these plugins don’t natively integrate with Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "meaning you can’t run a docker container and specify the network plugin to use is CNI and specify one\n",
    "\n",
    "of these plugins but that doesn't mean you can't use Docker with CNI at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just have to work around it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example create a docker container without any network configuration and then manually invoke the\n",
    "\n",
    "the bridge plugin yourself. That is pretty much how kubernetes does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When kubernetes creates docker containers it creates them on the none network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then invokes the configured CNI plugins who takes care of the rest of the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We talk about CNI in Kubernetes in the upcoming lectures.\n",

    "We look at the networking configurations required on the master and worker nodes in a kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubernetes cluster consists of master and worker nodes. Each node must have at least 1 interface\n",
    "\n",
    "connected to a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each interface must have an address configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hosts must have a unique hostname set. As well as a unique MAC address.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should note this especially if you created the VMs by cloning from existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some ports that needs to be opened as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are used by the various components in the control plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "The master should accept connections on 6443 for the API server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The worker nodes, Kubectl tool, external users, and all other control plane components access the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server via this port. The kubelets on the master and worker nodes listen on\n",
    "\n",
    "10250. Yes,\n",
    "\n",
    "in case we didn’t discuss this, the kubelet’s can be present on the master node as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-scheduler requires port 10251 to be open. The kube-controller-manager requires port\n",
    "\n",
    "10252 to be open. The worker nodes expose services for external access on ports 30000 to\n",
    "\n",
    "32767.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these should be open as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the ETCD server listens on port 2379.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have multiple master nodes, all of these ports need to be open on those as well. And you also need\n",
    "\n",
    "an additional port 2380 open so the ETCD clients can communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of ports to be opened are also available in the kubernetes documentation page.\n",
    "\n",
    "So consider these when you setup networking for your nodes, in your firewalls, or ip table rules or network\n",
    "\n",
    "security group in a cloud environment such as GCP or Azure or AWS. And if things are not working\n",
    "\n",
    "this is one place to look for while you are investigating. Head over to the practice session and explore\n",
    "\n",
    "the networking setup in the existing environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep this commands handy while you look for information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with simple exercises where you will explore an existing kubernetes cluster and view\n",
    "\n",
    "information about the interfaces, ips, hostnames, ports etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help you familiarize with the environment and look for information in the future sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward we will get into more challenging exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now let's start slow.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture we discuss about POD networking in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have setup several kubernetes master and worker nodes and configured networking between\n",
    "\n",
    "them so they are all on a network that can reach each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made sure the firewall and network security groups are configured correctly to allow for the\n",
    "\n",
    "kubernetes control plane components to reach each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we have also setup all the kubernetes control plane components such as the kube-api server,\n",
    "\n",
    "the etcd servers, kubelets etc. And we are finally ready to deploy our applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we can do that there is something that we must address.\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about the Network that connects the nodes together. But there is also another layer of networking\n",
    "\n",
    "that is crucial to the clusters functioning and that is the networking at the pod layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our kubernetes cluster is soon going to have a large number of PODs and services running on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How are these PODs addressed,\n",
    "\n",
    "How do they communicate with each other,\n",
    "\n",
    "how do you access the services running on these PODs internally from within the cluster, as well as\n",
    "\n",
    "externally from outside the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are challenges that kubernetes expects you to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of today, Kubernetes does not come with a built-in solution for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It expects you to implement a networking solution that solves these challenges. However, Kubernetes have\n",
    "\n",
    "laid out, clearly, the requirements for POD networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes expects every POD to get its own unique IP address. And that every POD should be able to\n",
    "\n",
    "reach every other POD within the same node using that IP address. And every pod should be able to reach\n",
    "\n",
    "every other pod on other nodes as well. Using the same IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't care what IP address that is and what range or subnet it belongs to as long as you can implement\n",
    "\n",
    "a solution that takes care of automatically assigning IP addresses and establish connectivity between\n",
    "\n",
    "the PODs in a node as well as PODs on different nodes,\n",
    "\n",
    "you are good. Without having to configure any NAT rules. So how do you implement a model that solves these\n",
    "\n",
    "requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are many networking solutions available out there that does these. But we have already learned\n",
    "\n",
    "about networking concepts, routing, IP Address management, namespaces and CNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's try to use that knowledge to solve this problem by ourselves first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help in understanding how other solutions work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I know there is a bit of repetition but I'm trying to relate the same concept and approach all the way\n",
    "\n",
    "way from plain network namespaces on Linux all the way to kubernetes. So we have a 3 node cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn’t matter which one is master or worker. They all run pods either for management or workload\n",
    "\n",
    "purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as networking is concerned we're going to consider all of them as the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first let's plan what we're going to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes are part of an external network and has IP addresses in the 192.168.1\n",
    "\n",
    "series. Node1 is assigned 11, node2 is 12 and node3 is 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step, When containers are created kubernetes creates network namespaces for them. To enable communication\n",
    "\n",
    "between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "we attach these namespaces to a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what network? We’ve learned about bridge networks that can be created within nodes to attach\n",
    "\n",
    "namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a bridge network on each node and then bring them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to assign an IP address to the bridge interfaces or networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decide that each bridge network will be on its own subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chose any private IP address range. Say 10.244.1, 10.244.2 and 10.244.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we said the IP address for the bridge interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have built our base.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining steps are to be performed for each container and everytime a new container is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we write a script for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you don't have to know any kind of complicated scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's just a file that has all commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using. And we can run this multiple times for each container going forward. To attach a container\n",
    "\n",
    "to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a pipe or virtual network cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create that using the ip link add command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't focus on the options as they are similar to what we saw in our previous lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that they vary depending on the inputs. We then\n",
    "\n",
    "attach one end to the container and another to the bridge using the ip link set command. We then\n",
    "\n",
    "assigned IP address using the\n",
    "\n",
    "ip addr command and add a route to default gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what IP do we add.\n",
    "\n",
    "We either manage that ourselves or store that information in some kind of database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will assume it is 10.244.1.2 which is a free IP in the subnet. We discuss about\n",
    "\n",
    "IP address management in detail in one of the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we bring up the interface. We then run the same script this time from the second container with\n",
    "\n",
    "its information and gets the container connected to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two containers can now communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We copy the script to the other nodes and run the script on them to assign IP address and connect those\n",
    "\n",
    "containers to their own internal networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have solved the first part of the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pods all get their own unique IP address and are able to communicate with each other on their own\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes. The next part to is to enable them to reach other PODs on other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example the pod at 10.244.1.2 on Node1 wants to ping pod 10.244.2.2\n",
    "\n",
    "on Node2.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now the first has no idea where the address 10.244.2.2 is, because it is on a different\n",
    "\n",
    "network than its own. So it routes to Node1’s IP as it is set to be the default gateway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Node1 doesn’t know either since 10.244.2.2 is a private network on Node2. Add a route to\n",
    "\n",
    "Node1s routing table to route traffic to 10.244.2.2 via seconds nodes IP at\n",
    "\n",
    "192.168.1.12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the route is added the bluepod is able to ping across.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly we configure route on all hosts to all other hosts with information regarding the respective\n",
    "\n",
    "networks within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this works fine in this simple setup. But this will require a lot more configuration as and when your\n",
    "\n",
    "underlying network architecture gets complicated instead of having to configure routes on each server\n",
    "\n",
    "a better solution is to do that on a router.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have one in your network and point all host to use that as the default gateway that way you can\n",
    "\n",
    "easily manage routes to all networks in the routing table on the router. With that the individual\n",
    "\n",
    "virtual networks we created with the address 10.244.1.0/24 on each node\n",
    "\n",
    "Now form a single large network with the address 10.244.0.0/16. It’s time to tie everything\n",
    "\n",
    "together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed a number of manual steps to get the environment ready with the bridge networks and routing\n",
    "\n",
    "tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then wrote a script that can be run for each container that performs the necessary steps required\n",
    "\n",
    "to connect each container to the network and we executed the script manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we don't want to do that as in large environments where thousands of parts are created every\n",
    "\n",
    "minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we run the script automatically when a pod is created on kubernetes?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where CNI comes in acting as the middleman.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNI tells kubernetes that this is how you should call a script\n",
    "\n",
    "as soon as you create a container. And CNI tells us this is how your script should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to modify the script a little bit to meet CNI’s standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should have an ADD section that will take care of adding a container to the network. And a delete section\n",
    "\n",
    "that will take care of deleting container interfaces from the network and freeing the IP address etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "So our script is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubelet on each node is responsible for creating containers. Whenever a container is created, the\n",
    "\n",
    "kubelet looks at the CNI configuration passed as a command line argument when it was run, and identifies\n",
    "\n",
    "our scripts name it then looks in the CNI bin directory to find our script and then executes the script\n",
    "\n",
    "with the add command and the name and namespace ID of the container. And then our scripts takes care\n",
    "\n",
    "of the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at how and where the CNI is configured in kubernetes in the next lecture along with practice\n",
    "\n",
    "tests. For now that’s it from the POD Networking concepts lecture. Hopefully that should give you enough\n",
    "\n",
    "knowledge on inspecting networking within PODs in a kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how other solutions do the same thing that we did in the upcoming lectures.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture will discuss about CNI in Kubernetes in the prerequisite lectures\n",
    "\n",
    "We started all the way from the absolute basics of network namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "then we saw how it is done in Docker, we then discussed why you need standards for networking containers\n",
    "\n",
    "and how the container network interface came to be\n",
    "\n",
    "and then we saw a list of supported plugins available with CNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will see how kubernetes is configured to use these network plugins. As we discussed in the\n",
    "\n",
    "pre-requisite lecture CNI defines the responsibilities of container runtime. As per CNI, container runtimes,\n",
    "\n",
    "in our case Kubernetes, is responsible for creating container network namespaces, identifying and\n",
    "\n",
    "attaching those namespaces to the right network by calling the right network plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where do we specify the CNI plugins for Kubernetes to use? The CNI plugin must be invoked by the\n",
    "\n",
    "component within Kubernetes that is responsible for creating containers. Because that component\n",
    "\n",
    "must then invoke the appropriate network plugin after the container is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNI plugin is configured in the kubelet service on each node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the kubelet service file, you will see an option called network-plugin set to CNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the same information on viewing the running kubelet service.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the network plugins set to CNI and a few other options related to CNI such as the CNI bin\n",
    "\n",
    "directory and CNI Config directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNI bin directory has all the supported CNI plugins as executables. Such as the bridge, dhcp, flannel\n",
    "\n",
    "etc. The CNI conflict directory has a set of configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where kubelet looks to find out which plugin needs to be used. In this case\n",
    "\n",
    "it finds the bridge configuration file. If there are multiple files here,\n",
    "\n",
    "It will choose the one in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the bridge conf file, it looks like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a format defined by the CNI standard for a plugin configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    ". It’s name is mynet, type is bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also has a set of other configurations which can be related to the concepts we discussed in the prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "lectures on bridging, routing and Masquerading in NAT. The isGateway defines whether the bridge network\n",
    "\n",
    "interface should get an IP address assigned so it can act as a gateway. The ipMasquerade defines\n",
    "\n",
    "if a NAT rule should be added for IP masquerading. The IPAM section defines IPAM configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you specify the subnet or the range of IP addresses that will be assigned to pods and\n",
    "\n",
    "any necessary routes. The type host-local indicates that the IP addresses are managed locally on this\n",
    "\n",
    "host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a DHCP server maintaining it remotely. The type can also be set to DHCP to configure an external DHCP\n",
    "\n",
    "server.\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss about one solution based on CNI in particular WeaveWorks. The WeaveWorks\n",
    "\n",
    "WeaveWorks weave CNI plugin. In the previous practice test,\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw how it is configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will see more details about how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start where we left off in the POD Networking Concepts section. We had our own custom CNI script\n",
    "\n",
    "that we built and integrated into kubelet through CNI. In the previous lecture we saw how, instead\n",
    "\n",
    "of our custom script, we can integrate the weave plugin. Let us now see how the weave solution works,\n",
    "\n",
    "as it is important to understand at least one solution\n",
    "\n",
    "well. You should then be able to relate this to other solutions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the networking solution we set up manually had a routing table which mapped what networks are on\n",
    "\n",
    "what hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when a packet is sent from one pod to the other, it goes out to the network, to the router and finds\n",
    "\n",
    "its way to the node that hosts that pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that works for a small environment and in a simple network. But in larger environments with 100s\n",
    "\n",
    "of nodes in a cluster and 100s of PODs on each node,\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The routing table may not support so many entries and that is where you need to get creative and look\n",
    "\n",
    "for other solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the kubernetes cluster as our company. And the nodes as different office sites. With each site,\n",
    "\n",
    "We have different departments and within each department we have different offices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone is office-1 wants to send a packet to office-3 and hands it over to the office boy. All he\n",
    "\n",
    "knows is it needs to go to office 3 and he doesn’t care who or how it is transported. The office\n",
    "\n",
    "boy takes the package, gets in his car, looks up address of the target office in GPS, uses directions\n",
    "\n",
    "on the street and finds his way to the destination site. Delivers the package to Payroll department\n",
    "\n",
    "who in turn forwards the package to office 3. This works just fine for now. We soon expand\n",
    "\n",
    "regions and countries and this process no longer works it's hard for the office boy to keep track of\n",
    "\n",
    "so many routes to these large number of offices across different countries and of course he can’t drive\n",
    "\n",
    "to these offices by himself. That’s where we decide to outsource all mailing and shipping activities\n",
    "\n",
    "to a company who does it best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the shipping company is engaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing that they do is place their agents in each of our company's sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "These agents are responsible for managing all shipping activities between sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also keep talking to each other and are well connected so they all know about each other's sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The departments in them and the offices in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so when a package is sent from say office 10 to office 3 the shipping agent in that site intercepts\n",
    "\n",
    "the package, and looks at the target office name,\n",
    "\n",
    "He knows exactly in which site and department that office is in through his little internal network\n",
    "\n",
    "with his peers on the other sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "He then places this package into his own new package with the destination address said to the target\n",
    "\n",
    "sites location and then sends the package through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the package arrives at the destination it is again intercepted by the agent on that site.\n",
    "\n",
    "He opens the packet retrieves the original packet and delivers it to the right department. Back to a\n",
    "\n",
    "world, when the weave CNI plugin is deployed on a cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "it deploys an agent or service on each node. They communicate with each other to exchange information\n",
    "\n",
    "regarding the nodes and networks and PODs within them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent or peer stores a topology of the entire setup,\n",
    "\n",
    "that way they know the pods and their IPs on the other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weave creates its own bridge on the nodes and names it\n",
    "\n",
    "weave. Then assigns IP address to each network. The Ips shown here are examples only. In the upcoming\n",
    "\n",
    "practice test.\n",
    "\n",
    "test you will figure out the exact range of IP addresses weave assigns on each node.\n",
    "\n",

    "Remember that a single POD may be attached to multiple bridge networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you could have a pod attached to the weave bridge as well as the docker bridge created by\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "What path a packet takes to reach destination depends on the route configured on the container. Weave\n",
    "\n",
    "makes sure that PODs get the correct route configured to reach the agent. And the agent then takes care\n",
    "\n",
    "of other PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "now when a packet is sent from one pod to another on another node, weave intercepts the packet and identifies\n",
    "\n",
    "that it's on a separate network.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then encapsulates this packet into a new one with new source and destination and sends it across\n",
    "\n",
    "the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once on the other side, the other weave agent retrieves the packet, decapsulates and routes the packet\n",
    "\n",
    "to the right POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we deploy weave on a kubernetes cluster?\n",
    "\n",
    "Weave and weave peers can be deployed as services or daemons on each node in the cluster manually or\n",
    "\n",
    "if kubernetes is setup already\n",
    "\n",
    "Then an easier way to do that is to deploy it as pods in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the base kubernetes system is ready with nodes and networking configured correctly between the\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes and the basic control plan components are deployed, weave can be deployed in the cluster with a single\n",
    "\n",
    "kubectl apply command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This deploys all the necessary components required for weave in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly the weave peers are deployed as a daemonset. A daemonset ensures that one pod of\n",
    "\n",
    "the given kind is deployed on all nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works perfectly for the weave peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deployed your cluster with the kubeadm tool and weave plugin, you can see the weave peers as pods\n",
    "\n",
    "deployed on each node. For troubleshooting purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "view the logs using the kubectl logs\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture and this lecture we discussed about IP address management.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does IP address management work and cobra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice this section does not concern the IP address assigned to the nodes in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can manage that on your own or with your own external Pam solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this section covers is however the word tool brutes networks and the nodes assigned an IP subnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how are the parts assigned an IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is this information stored and who is responsible for ensuring there are no duplicate IP is assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with The Who.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's ask CNI as they're the ones who define the standards CNI says it is the responsibility of the\n",
    "\n",
    "CNI plug in the network solution provider to take care of assigning IP to the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the basic plugin we built earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We actually took care of assigning IP addresses within this plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a section for assigning IP to the container network namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we manage these APIs competent is doesn't care how we do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just need to do it by making sure we don't assign any duplicate APIs and manage it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy way to do it is to store the list of APIs in a file and make sure we have necessary code in\n",
    "\n",
    "our script to manage this file properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file would be placed on each host and manages the APIs of parts on those notes instead of coding\n",
    "\n",
    "that ourselves in our script CNI comes with two built in plugins to which you can outsource this task\n",
    "\n",
    "to.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the plugin that implements the approach that we followed for managing the IP addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "locally on each host is the host local plugin but is still our responsibility to invoke that plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "in our script or we can make our script dynamic to support different kinds of plugins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNI configuration file has a section called APM in which we can specify the type of plug in to be\n",
    "\n",
    "used the subnet and route to be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This details can be read from our script to invoke the appropriate plugin instead of hard coding it\n",
    "\n",
    "to use hosted local every time different network solution providers does it differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we works managers IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact you have seen some of the APIs assigned by Reef in the previous practice test.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've by default allocates the appearance tender to 0 0 0 slash twelve for the entire network.\n",
    "\n",
    "That gives the network IP from range tender 32 of 0 1 to 10 not 47 not 255 but 254.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's about a million APIs that you can use for part on the network from this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The peers decide to split the IP addresses equally between them and assigns one portion to each node\n",
    "\n",
    "pods created.\n",
    "\n",
    "On this note we'll have is in this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course these ranges are configurable with additional options past while deploying the weave plug\n",
    "\n",
    "into a cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296162#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss about service networking. In the previous lectures\n",
    "\n",
    "we talked about POD networking. How bridge networks are created within each node and how PODs get a\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace created for them and how interfaces are attached to those name spaces and how parts get an\n",
    "\n",
    "IP address assigned to them within the subnet assigned for that note.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we also saw through routes or other overlay techniques, we can get the PODs in different nodes to talk\n",
    "\n",
    "to each other forming a large virtual network where all pods can reach each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you would rarely configure your pods to communicate directly with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a pod to access services hosted on another pod you would always use a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly recap the different kinds of services. To make the orange pod accessible to the blue pod,\n",
    "\n",
    "we create an orange service. The orange service gets an IP address and a name assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blue pod can now access the orange pod through the orange services IP or its name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about name resolution in the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now let's just focus on IP addresses. The blue and orange pod around the same node.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about access from the other PODs\n",
    "\n",
    "on other nodes? when a service is created it is accessible from all parts of the cluster, irrespective\n",
    "\n",
    "of what nodes the pods are on. While a pod is hosted on a node, a service is hosted across the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not bound to a specific node. But remember, the service is only accessible from within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of service is known as ClusterIP.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the orange POD was hosting a database application that is to be only accessed from within the cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "then this type of service works just fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for instance the purple pod was hosting a web application. To make the application on the pod accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "outside the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "we create another service of type NodePort.\n",
    "\n",
    "This service also gets an IP address assigned to it and works just like ClusterIP. As in all the other\n",
    "\n",
    "PODs can access this service using it’s IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, in addition it also exposes the application on a port on all nodes in the cluster. That way external\n",
    "\n",
    "users or applications have access to the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the topic of our discussion for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our focus is more on services and less on PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How are the services getting these IP addresses and how are they made available across all the nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is the service made available to external users through a port on each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is doing that and how and where do we see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start on a clean slate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a three node cluster, no pods or services yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that every kubernetes node runs a kubelet process, which is responsible for creating PODs. Each\n",
    "\n",
    "kubelet service on each node\n",
    "\n",
    "watches the changes in the cluster through the kube-api server,\n",
    "\n",
    "and every time a new POD is to be created, it creates the POD on the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then invokes the CNI plugin to configure networking for that POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, each node runs another component known as kube-proxy. Kube\n",
    "\n",
    "proxy watches the changes in the cluster through kube-api server, and every time a new service is to be created,\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-proxy gets into action. Unlike PODs, services are not created on each node or assigned to each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Services are a cluster wide concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "They exist across all the nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a matter of fact they don't exist at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no server or service really listening on the IP of the service. We have seen that\n",
    "\n",
    "PODs have containers and containers have namespaces with interfaces and Ips assigned to those interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "With services\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing like that exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no processes or name spaces or interfaces for a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's just a virtual object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then how do they get an IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "and how were we able to access the application on the pod through service?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a service object in kubernetes, it is assigned an IP address from a pre-defined range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-proxy components running on each node, get’s that IP address and creates forwarding rules on\n",
    "\n",
    "each node in the cluster, saying any traffic coming to this IP, the IP of the service, should go to the\n",
    "\n",
    "IP of the POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that is in place, whenever a POD tries to reach the IP of the service, it is forwarded to the PODs\n",
    "\n",
    "IP address which is accessible from any node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember it's not just the IP it's an IP and port combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever services are created or deleted the kube-proxy component creates or deletes these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how are these rules created? kube-proxy supports different ways, such as userspace where kube-proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "listens on a port for each service and proxies connections to the pods. By creating ipvs rules or\n",
    "\n",
    "the third and the default option and the one familiar to us is using IP tables. The proxy mode can be\n",
    "\n",
    "set using the proxy mode option while configuring the kube-proxy service\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is not set, it defaults to iptables. So we’ll see how iptables are configured by kube-proxy and\n",
    "\n",
    "how you can view them on the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a pod named db deployed on node-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "it has IP address 10.244.1.2. We create a service of type ClusterIP to make this pod\n",
    "\n",
    "available within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the service is created kubernetes assigns an IP address to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is set to 10.103.132.104\n",
    "\n",
    "This range is specified in the kube-apiservers\n",
    "\n",
    "option called service-cluster-ip-range. Which is by default set to 10.0.0.0/24.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case, if I look at my kube-api-server option. I see it is set to 10.96.0.0/12.\n",
    "\n",
    "That gives my services IP any where from 10.96.0.0 to 10.111.255.255. A relative\n",
    "\n",
    "point to mention here.\n",
    "\n",
    "when I setup my POD networking, I provided a POD network CIDR range of 10.244.0.0/16\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives my pods IP addresses from 10.244.0.0 to 10.244.255.255.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason I brought this up here is because whatever range is specified for each of these networks\n",
    "\n",
    "it shouldn't overlap which it doesn't\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case. Both of these should have its own dedicated range of IPs to work with. There shouldn't\n",
    "\n",
    "be a case where a POD and a service are assigned the same IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "So getting back to services.\n",
    "\n",
    "that’s how my service got an IP address of 10.103.132.104.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the rules created by kube-proxy in the iptables\n",
    "\n",
    "nat table output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for the name of the service as all rules created by kube-proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "have a comment with the name of the service on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules mean, any traffic going to IP address 10.103.132.104 on port 3306\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the IP of the service, should have its destination address changed to 10.244.1.2 and port 3306 which is the IP of the POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "which is the IP of the service, should have its destination address changed to 10.244.1.2 and port 3306 which is the IP of the POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by adding a DNAT rule to IP tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when you create services of type NodePort, kube-proxy creates IPTable rules to forward all\n",
    "\n",
    "traffic coming on a port on all nodes to the respective backend PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see kube-proxy create these entries in the kube-proxy logs itself. In the logs\n",
    "\n",
    "you will find what proxier it uses, in this case its IP tables and the Add an entry when it added\n",
    "\n",
    "a new service for the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the location of this file might vary depending on your installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't see these entries you must also check the verbosity level of the process as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it about service networking.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "we will discuss about DNS in the Kubernetes cluster. If you are new to DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "make sure you go through the prerequisite section on DNS where we discuss what DNS is,\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the tools used for working with DNS such as host, NS Lookup and dig utility and the different\n",
    "\n",
    "types of DNS records like A, CNAME etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we also saw how to setup our own DNS server using CoreDNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will see what names are assigned to what objects, what our service DNS records, POD\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS records,\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the different ways you can reach one part from another. In the next lecture,\n",
    "\n",
    "we will see how Kubernetes implements DNS in the cluster. So we have a 3 node kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "with some PODs and services deployed on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node has a nodename and IP address assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The node names and IP addresses of the cluster are probably registered in a DNS server in your organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how that is managed who accesses them are not of concern\n",
    "\n",
    "in this lecture. In this lecture we discuss about DNS resolution within the cluster between the different\n",
    "\n",
    "components in the cluster such as PODs and services. Kubernetes deploys a built-in DNS server by default\n",
    "\n",
    "when you setup a cluster. If you setup kubernetes manually, then you do it by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how that is done and how it is configured in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as this lecture is concerned we will see how it helps pods resolve other pods and services\n",
    "\n",
    "within the cluster. So we don't really care about\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes. We focus purely on PODs and services within the cluster. As long as our cluster networking is set\n",
    "\n",
    "up correctly, following the best practices we learned so far in this section, and all pods and services\n",
    "\n",
    "can get their own IP address and can reach each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start with just two PODs and a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have a test pod on the left with the IP set to 10.244.1.5. And I have a web pod\n",
    "\n",
    "on the right, with the IP set to 10.244.2.5. Looking at their IPs,\n",
    "\n",
    "you can guess that they are probably hosted on two different nodes. But that doesn’t matter, as far\n",
    "\n",
    "as DNS is concerned.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that all PODs and services can reach other using their IP addresses. To make the web\n",
    "\n",
    "server accessible to the test pod,\n",
    "\n",
    "we create a service. We name it\n",
    "\n",
    "Web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service gets an IP 10.107.37.188. Whenever a service is created, the kubernetes DNS service creates\n",
    "\n",
    "a record for the service. It maps the service name to the IP address. So within the cluster any pod can\n",
    "\n",
    "now reach the service using its service name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we talked about name spaces earlier. That everyone within the namespace address each other just\n",
    "\n",
    "with their first names and to address anyone in another namespace you use their full names ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case since the test pod and the web pod and its associated service are all in the same namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default namespace. You were able to simply reach the web-service from the test pod using just the\n",
    "\n",
    "service name web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the web service was in a separate namespace named apps. Then to refer to it from the default\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "you would have to say web-service.apps. The last name of the service is now the name of the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here web service is the name of the service and apps is the name of the namespace. For each namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNS server creates a subdomain. All the services are grouped together into another subdomain called\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what was that about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look.\n",
    "\n",
    "web-service is the name of the service and apps is the name of the namespace. For each namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "the DNS server creates a subdomain with its name. All pods and services for a namespace are thus grouped\n",
    "\n",
    "together within a subdomain in the name of the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the services are grouped together into another subdomain called svc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can reach your application with the name web-service.apps.svc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, all the services and PODs are grouped together into a root domain for the cluster, which is\n",
    "\n",
    "set to cluster.local by default. So you can access the service using the URL\n",
    "\n",
    "web-service.apps.svc.cluster.local. And that’s the fully qualified domain name for the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's how services are resolved within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about PODs? Records for PODs are not created by default. But we can enable that explicitly,\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see that in the next lecture. Once enabled,\n",
    "\n",
    "Records are created for pods as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does not use the POD name though. For each POD kubernetes generates a name by replacing the dots\n",
    "\n",
    "in the IP address with dashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The namespace remains the same and type is set to pod. The root domain is always cluster.local.\n",

    "\n",
    "to a dashed hostname 10-244-1-5 and namespace set to default, type is POD\n",

    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296166#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will discuss how Kubernetes implements DNS in\n",
    "\n",
    "the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lecture we saw how you can address a service or pod from another pod. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will see how kubernetes makes that possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you were given two pods with two IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what we learned in the prerequisite lectures on DNS,\n",
    "\n",
    "an easy way to get them to resolve each other is to add an entry into each of their /etc/hosts files. On\n",
    "\n",
    "the first pod\n",
    "\n",
    "I would say the second pod web is at 10.244.2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "and on the second pod I would say the first pod test is at 10.244.1.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "But of course, when you have 1000s of PODs in the cluster, and 100s of them being created and\n",
    "\n",
    "deleted every minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a suitable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we move these entries into a central DNS server. We then point these PODs to the DNS server by\n",
    "\n",
    "adding an entry into their /etc/resolv.conf file specifying that the nameserver is at the IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "of the DNS server, which happens to be 10.96.0.10\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case. Every time a new pod is created, we add a record in the DNS server for that pod so that\n",
    "\n",
    "other pods can access the new POD, and configure the /etc/resolv.conf file in the POD to\n",
    "\n",
    "the DNS server so that the pod can resolve\n",
    "\n",
    "other pods in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is kind of how kubernetes does it. Except that it does not create similar entries for PODs to map podname\n",
    "\n",
    "to its IP address as we have seen in the previous lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does that for services. For pods it forms host names by replacing dots with dashes in the IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "of the pod. Kubernetes implements DNS in the same way. It deploys a DNS server within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to version v1.12 the DNS implemented by kubernetes was known as kube-dns. With Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "version 1.12 the recommended DNS server is CoreDNS. We took a brief look at a core DNS in one of\n",
    "\n",
    "the prerequisite lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is the core DNS setup in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CoreDNS server is deployed as a POD in the kube-system namespace in the kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well they are deployed as two pods for redundancy, as part of a replicaset.\n",
    "\n",
    "they are actually a replicaset within a deployment. But it doesn’t really matter. We’ll just see\n",
    "\n",
    "CoreDNS as a POD in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This POD runs the coreDNS executable, the same executable that we ran when we deployed CoreDNS\n",
    "\n",
    "ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "CoreDNS requires a configuration file. In our case\n",
    "\n",
    "we used a file named Corefile. So does kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a file named Corefile located at /etc/coredns. Within this file\n",
    "\n",
    "you have a number of plugins configured. The ones highlighted in orange. Plugins are configured for handling\n",
    "\n",
    "errors, reporting health, monitoring metrics, cache etc. The plugin that makes CoreDNS work with\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes, is the kubernetes plugin. And this is where the top level domain name for the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "is set. In this case cluster.local. So every record in the coredns DNS server falls under this\n",
    "\n",
    "domain. Within the kubernetes plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "there are multiple options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pods option you see here, is what is responsible for creating a record for PODs in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we talked about a record being created for each POD by converting their IPs into a dashed\n",
    "\n",
    "format that's disabled by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it can be enabled with this entry here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any record that this DNS server can’t solve, for example say a POD tries to reach www.google.com\n",
    "\n",
    "it is forwarded to the nameserver specified in the coredns pods /etc/resolv.conf file. The\n",
    "\n",
    "/etc/resolv.conf file is set to use the nameserver from the kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Node. Also note, that this core file is passed into the pod has a configMap object. That way if you\n",
    "\n",
    "need to modify this configuration you can edit the ConfigMap object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have the coredns pod up and running using the appropriate kubernetes plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "It watches the kubernetes cluster for new PODs or services, and every time a pod or a service is created it\n",
    "\n",
    "adds a record for it in its database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is for the pod to point to the coreDNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "What address do the PODs use to reach the DNS server? When we deploy CoreDNS solution,\n",
    "\n",
    "It also creates a service to make it available to other components within a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service is named as kube-dns by default. The IP address of this service is configured as\n",
    "\n",
    "nameserver on the PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you don’t have to configure this yourself. The DNS configurations on PODs are done by kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "automatically when the PODs are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to guess which kubernetes component is responsible for that? The kubelet.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the config file of the kubelet you will see the IP of the DNS server and domain in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the pods are configured with the right nameserver, you can now resolve other pods and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the web-service using just web-service, or web-service.default or web-service.default.svc or web-service.default.svc.cluster.local.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the web-service using just web-service, or web-service.default or web-service.default.svc or web service.default.svc.cluster.local.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to manually lookup the web-service using nslookup or the host command web-service command, it\n",
    "\n",
    "will return the fully qualified domain name of the web-service, which happens to be web-service.default.svc.cluster.local.\n",
    "\n",
    "will return the fully qualified domain name of the web-service, which happens to be web-service.default.svc.cluster.local.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you didn't ask for that you just set up service.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how did it look up for the full name.\n",
    "\n",
    "It so happens, the resolv.conf file also has a search entry which is set to default.svc.cluster.local\n",
    "\n",
    "as well as svc.cluster.local and cluster.local.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to find the service using any name. web-service or web-service.default or web-service.default.svc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to find the service using any name. web-service or web-service.default or web-service.default.svc.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, notice that it only has search entries for service . So you won’t be able to reach a pod the same\n",
    "\n",
    "way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that you need to specify the full FQDN of the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in this lecture we will discuss about ingress in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common questions that students reach out about usually is regarding services and ingress.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the difference between the two and when to use what.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we're going to briefly revisit services and work our way towards ingress.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with a simple scenario. You are deploying an application on Kubernetes for a company\n",
    "\n",
    "that has an online store selling products. Your application would be available at say my-online-store.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "You build the application into a Docker Image and deploy it on the kubernetes cluster as a\n",
    "\n",
    "POD in a Deployment. Your application needs a database so you deploy a MySQL database as a POD\n",
    "\n",
    "and create a service of type ClusterIP called mysql-service to make it accessible to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your application is now working. To make the application accessible to the outside world, you create another\n",
    "\n",
    "service, this time of type NodePort and make your application available on a high-port on the nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example a port 38080 is allocated for the service. The users can now access your application\n",
    "\n",
    "using the URL: http: // IP of any of your nodes followed by port\n",
    "\n",
    "38080. That setup works and users are able to access the application. Whenever traffic increases, we increase\n",
    "\n",
    "the number of replicas of the pod to handle the additional traffic and the service takes care of splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "traffic between the pods however if you have deployed a production grade application before you know\n",
    "\n",
    "that there are many more things involved in addition to simply splitting the traffic between the pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example we do not want the users to have to type in IP address every time you configure your DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "server to point to the IP of the nodes your users can now access your application using the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "my-online-store.com and port 38080.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you don't want your users to have to remember port number either.\n",
    "\n",
    "However service node ports can only allocate high numbered ports which are greater than 30000\n",
    "\n",
    "so you then bring in an additional layer between the DNS server and your cluster like a proxy server\n",
    "\n",
    "that proxies requests on port 80 to port 38080 on your nodes. You then point your DNS to this\n",
    "\n",
    "server, and users can now access your application by simply visiting my-online-store.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is if your application is hosted on prem in your data center.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back and see what you could do if you were on a public cloud environment like Google\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, instead of creating a service of type NodePort for your wear application, you could set it to\n",
    "\n",
    "type load balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you do that Kubernetes would still do everything that it has to do for a NodePort, which is to\n",
    "\n",
    "provision a high port for the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "but in addition to that kubernetes also sends a request to Google Cloud Platform to provision a network\n",
    "\n",
    "load balancer for the service on receiving the request DCP would then automatically deploy a load balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "configured to route traffic to the service ports on all the nodes and return its information to kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoadBalancer has an external IP that can be provided to users to access the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we set the DNS to point to this IP and users access the application using the URL\n",
    "\n",
    "my-online-store.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect your company's business grows and you now have new services for your customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a video streaming service you want your users to be able to access your new video streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "service by going to my-online-store.com/watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’d like to make your old application accessible at my-online.store.com / wear. Your developers\n",
    "\n",
    "developed the new video streaming application as a completely different application as it has nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "to do with the existing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in order to share the same cluster resources you deploy the new application as a separate deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "within the same cluster. You create a service called video-service of type LoadBalancer. Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "provisions port 38282 for this service and also provisions a Network LoadBalancer on the cloud. The\n",
    "\n",
    "new load balancer has a new IP remember you must pay for each of these load balancers and having many\n",
    "\n",
    "such load balancers can inversely affect your cloud build.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you direct traffic between each of these load balancers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the URL that the users type in you need yet another proxy or load balancer that can redirect\n",
    "\n",
    "traffic based on URLs to the different services. Every time you introduce a new service\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to reconfigure the load balancer and finally you also need to enable SSL for your applications\n",
    "\n",
    "so your users can access your application using https.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do you configure that?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be done at different levels either at the application level itself or at the load balancer or\n",
    "\n",
    "proxy server level but which one you don't want your developers to implement it in their application\n",
    "\n",
    "as they would do it in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want it to be configured in one place with minimal maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that's a lot of different configuration and all of this becomes difficult to manage when your application\n",
    "\n",
    "scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires involving different individuals in different teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to configure your firewall rules for each new service and it's expensive as well as for each\n",
    "\n",
    "service in you cloud native load balancer needs to be provision wouldn't it be nice if you could manage\n",
    "\n",
    "all of that within the Kubernetes cluster, and have all that configuration as just another kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "as definition file that lives along with the rest of your application deployment files that's where\n",
    "\n",
    "ingress comes in ingress helps your users access your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "using a single Externally accessible URL, that you can configure to route to different services\n",
    "\n",
    "within your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "based on the URL path,\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time implement SSL security as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put.\n",
    "\n",
    "think of ingress as a layer 7 load balancer built-in to the kubernetes cluster that can be configured\n",
    "\n",
    "using native kubernetes primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "just like any other object in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember, even with Ingress you still need to expose it\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it accessible outside the cluster so you still have to either publish it as a node port or with\n",
    "\n",
    "a cloud native load balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that is just a one time configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward you are going to perform all your load balancing, Auth, SSL and URL based\n",
    "\n",
    "routing configurations on the Ingress controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you see it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can you configure it\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it load balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it implement SSL? Without ingress,\n",
    "\n",
    "how would YOU do all of these? I would use a reverse-proxy or a load balancing solution like\n",
    "\n",
    "NGINX or HAProxy or Traefik. I would deploy them on my kubernetes cluster and configure them to route traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "to other services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration involves defining URL Routes, configuring SSL certificates etc. Ingress is implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "by Kubernetes in kind of the same way. You first deploy a supported solution, which happens to be any of these\n",
    "\n",
    "listed here and then specify a set of rules to configure ingress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution you deploy is called as an ingress controller and the set of rules you configure are called\n",
    "\n",
    "as ingress resources ingress resources are created using definition files like the ones we use to create\n",
    "\n",
    "pods deployments and services\n",
    "\n",
    "earlier in this course. Now remember a kubernetes cluster does NOT come with an Ingress Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you setup a cluster following the demos in this course, you won’t have an ingress controller built\n",
    "\n",
    "into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you simply create ingress resources and expect them to work they won't let us look at each of\n",
    "\n",
    "these in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned you do not have an Ingress Controller on Kubernetes by default. So you MUST deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "one. What do you deploy?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of solutions available for ingress.\n",
    "\n",
    "a few of them being GCE - which is Googles Layer 7\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Load Balancer. NGINX, Contour, HAPROXY, TRAFIK and Istio. Out of this, GCE and NGINX\n",
    "\n",
    "are currently being supported and maintained by the Kubernetes project.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in this lecture we will use NGINX as an example. These Ingress Controllers are not just another\n",
    "\n",
    "load balancer or nginx server. The load balancer components are just a part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ingress controllers have additional intelligence built into them to monitor the kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "for new definitions or ingress resources and configure the nginx server accordingly. An NGINX\n",
    "\n",
    "Controller is deployed as just another deployment in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start with a deployment file definition, named nginx-ingress-controller. With 1 replica and\n",
    "\n",
    "a simple pod definition template.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will label it nginx-ingress and the image used is nginx-ingress-controller with the right\n",
    "\n",
    "version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is a special build of NGINX built specifically to be used as an ingress controller in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is a special build of NGINX built specifically to be used as an ingress controller in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it has its own set of requirements. Within the image the nginx program is stored at location\n",
    "\n",
    "/nginx-ingress-controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you must pass that as the command to start\n",
    "\n",
    "the nginx-controller-service.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have worked with NGINX before, you know that it has a set of configuration options such as\n",
    "\n",
    "the path to store the logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "keep-alive threshold, ssl settings, session timeout etc. In order to decouple these configuration data\n",
    "\n",
    "data from the nginx-controller image, you must create a ConfigMap object and pass that in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember the ConfigMap object need not have any entries at this point. A blank object will do.\n",
    "\n",
    "But creating one makes it easy for you to modify a configuration setting in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will just have to add it in to this ConfigMap and not have to worry about modifying the nginx\n",
    "\n",
    "configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also pass in two environment variables that carry the POD’s name and namespace it is deployed\n",
    "\n",
    "to. The nginx service requires these to read the configuration data from within the POD. And finally\n",
    "\n",
    "specify the ports used by the ingress controller which happens to be 80 and 443.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then need a service to expose the ingress controller to the external world.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we create a service of type NodePort with the nginx-ingress label selector to link the service\n",
    "\n",
    "to the deployment. As mentioned before, the Ingress controllers have additional intelligence built into\n",
    "\n",
    "them to monitor the kubernetes cluster for ingress resources and configure the underlying nginx\n",
    "\n",
    "server when something is changed but for the ingress controller to do this it requires a service account\n",
    "\n",
    "with a right set of permissions for that we create a service account with the correct roles and roles\n",
    "\n",
    "bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize, with a deployment of the nginx-ingress image, a service to expose it, a ConfigMap\n",
    "\n",
    "to feed nginx configuration data, and a service account with the right permissions to access\n",
    "\n",
    "all of these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should be ready with an increase controller in its simplest form now on onto the next part of creating\n",
    "\n",
    "ingress resources an increase resource is a set of rules and configurations applied on the ingress\n",
    "\n",
    "controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure rules to say simply forward all incoming traffic to a single application or route traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "to different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if user goes to my-online-store.com/wear, then route to one app, or if\n",
    "\n",
    "the user visits the /watch URL then route to the video app. Or you could route user based on the\n",
    "\n",
    "domain name itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the user visits wear.my-online-store.com, the route to the wear app\n",
    "\n",
    "or else route to the video app. Let us look at how to configure these in a bit more detail. The Ingress\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource is created with a Kubernetes Definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, ingress-wear.yaml. As with any other object,\n",
    "\n",
    "we have apiVersion, kind, metadata and spec. The apiVersion is extensions/v1beta1, kind is Ingress,\n",
    "\n",
    "we will name it ingress-wear. And under spec we have backend. So the traffic is, of course, routed\n",
    "\n",
    "to the application services and not PODs directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might know already the back end section defines where the traffic will be routed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if it's a single backend then you don't really have any rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simply specify the service name and port of the backend wear service. Create the ingress resource\n",
    "\n",
    "by running the kubectl create command. View the created ingress by running the kubectl\n",
    "\n",
    "get ingress command. The new ingress is now created and routes all incoming traffic directly to the\n",
    "\n",
    "wear-service. You use rules, when you want to route traffic based on different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you create one rule for traffic originating from each domain or hostname.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means when users reach your cluster using the domain name, my-online-store.com, you can handle\n",
    "\n",
    "that traffic using rule1. When users reach your cluster using domain name wear.my-online-store\n",
    "\n",
    ".com, you can handle that traffic using a separate Rule2. Use Rule3 to handle traffic from\n",
    "\n",
    "watch.my-online-store.com. And say use a 4th rule to handle everything else. Now within each\n",
    "\n",
    "rule you can handle different paths. For example, within Rule 1 you can handle the wear path to route that\n",
    "\n",
    "traffic to the clothes application. And a watch path to route traffic to the video streaming application.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a third path that routes\n",
    "\n",
    "anything other than the first two to a 404 not found page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the second rule handles all traffic from wear.my-online-store.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have path definition within this rule, to route traffic based on different paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say you have different applications and services within the apparel section for shopping,\n",
    "\n",
    "or returns, or support, when a user goes to\n",
    "\n",
    "wear.my-online.store.com/, by default\n",
    "\n",
    "they reach the shopping page.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if they go to exchange or support URL, they reach different backend services.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same goes for Rule 3, where you route traffic to watch.my-online-store.com to the video streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "application. But you can have additional paths in it such as movies or tv. And finally anything other\n",
    "\n",
    "than the ones listed here will go to the fourth rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "that would simply show a 404 Not Found Error page.\n",
    "\n",
    "So remember you have rules at the top for each host or domain name and within each rule you have different\n",
    "\n",
    "paths to route traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "based on the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s look at how we configure ingress resources in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start where we left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a similar definition file. This time under spec,\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our requirement here is to handle all traffic coming to my-online-store.com and route them based\n",
    "\n",
    "on the URL path.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we just need a single rules for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "since we are only handling traffic to a single domain name, which is my-online-store.com. Under rules\n",
    "\n",
    "we have one item, which is an http rule in which we specify different paths. So paths is an array of\n",
    "\n",
    "multiple items.\n",
    "\n",
    "One path for each\n",
    "\n",
    "url. Then we move the backend\n",
    "\n",
    "we used in the first example under the first path. The backend specification remains the same,\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a service name and service port.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly we create a similar backend entry to the second URL path, for the watch-service to route\n",
    "\n",
    "all traffic coming in through the /watch url to the watch-service. Create the ingress resource using\n",
    "\n",
    "the kubectl create command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once created, view additional details about the ingress resource by running the kubectl\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe ingress command.\n",
    "\n",
    "You now see two backend URLs under the rules, and the backend service they are pointing to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as we created it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you look closely in the output of this command you see that there is something about a default\n",
    "\n",
    "Back end. Hmmm.\n",
    "\n",
    "What might that be? If a user tries to access a URL that does not match any of these rules,\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the user is directed to the service specified as the default backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it happens to be a service named default-http-backend. So you must remember\n",
    "\n",
    "to deploy such a service back in your application\n",
    "\n",
    "say a user visits the URL my-online-store.com/listen or /eat and you don’t have an\n",
    "\n",
    "audio streaming or a food delivery service.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to show them a nice message.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by configuring a default backend service to display this 404\n",
    "\n",
    "Not found error page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third type of configuration is using domain names or host names.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by creating a similar definition file for ingress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have two domain names we create two rules one for each domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Display traffic by domain name.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the host field the host field in each rule matches the specified value with the domain name used\n",
    "\n",
    "in the request URL and routes traffic to the appropriate backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember in the previous case we did not specify the host field.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't specify the host field it will simply consider it as a star or accept all the incoming\n",
    "\n",
    "traffic through that particular rule without matching the hostname in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we only have a single back and path for each rule which is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "All traffic from these domain names will be routed to the appropriate backend irrespective of the\n",
    "\n",
    "URL path.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can still have multiple path specifications in each of these to handle different URL paths as\n",
    "\n",
    "we saw in the example earlier so let's compare the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting traffic by URL had just one rule and we split the traffic with two paths. Display traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "by hostname.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used two rules and one path specification in each rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now head over to the practice test section and practice working on ingress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are two types of labs in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is where an ingress controller resources and applications are already deployed and you\n",
    "\n",
    "basically view and walk through the environment gather data and answer questions towards the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would create or modify ingress resources based on the needs in the second practice test which is\n",
    "\n",
    "a bit more challenging and that is where you will be deploying an ingress controller and resources\n",
    "\n",
    "from scratch.\n",
    "\n",

    "Different ingress controllers have different options that can be used to customise the way it works. NGINX Ingress controller has many options that can be seen here. I would like to explain one such option that we will use in our labs. The Rewrite target option.\n",

    "Our watch app displays the video streaming webpage at http://<watch-service>:<port>/\n",
    "\n",
    "Our wear app displays the apparel webpage at http://<wear-service>:<port>/\n",
    "\n",
    "We must configure Ingress to achieve the below. When user visits the URL on the left, his request should be forwarded internally to the URL on the right. Note that the /watch and /wear URL path are what we configure on the ingress controller so we can forwarded users to the appropriate application in the backend. The applications don't have this URL/Path configured on them:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/watch --> http://<watch-service>:<port>/\n",

    "\n",
    "http://<ingress-service>:<ingress-port>/wear --> http://<wear-service>:<port>/wear\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice watch and wear at the end of the target URLs. The target applications are not configured with /watch or /wear paths. They are different applications built specifically for their purpose, so they don't expect /watch or /wear in the URLs. And as such the requests would fail and throw a 404 not found error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix that we want to \"ReWrite\" the URL when the request is passed on to the watch or wear applications. We don't want to pass in the same path that user typed in. So we specify the rewrite-target option. This rewrites the URL by replacing whatever is under rules->http->paths->path which happens to be /pay in this case with the value in rewrite-target. This works just like a search and replace function.\n",
