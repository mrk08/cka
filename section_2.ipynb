    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a basic overview of the Kubernetes cluster architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first look at the architecture at a high level and then we drill down into each of these components\n",
    "\n",
    "we see what their roles and responsibilities are and how they are configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, you go through a practice test where you look at an existing cluster and are asked to identify\n",
    "\n",
    "various details with respect to these components in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use an analogy of ships to understand the architecture of Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Kubernetes is to host your applications in the form of containers in an automated fashion\n",
    "\n",
    "so that you can easily deploy as many instances of your application as required and easily enable communication\n",
    "\n",
    "between different services within your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are many things involved that work together to make this possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's take a 10000 feet look at the Kubernetes architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two kinds of ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example cargo ships that does the actual work of carrying containers across to sea and control\n",
    "\n",
    "ships that are responsible for monitoring and managing the cargo ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes which may be physical or virtual on-premise or\n",
    "\n",
    "on cloud that host applications in the form of containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These relate to the cargo ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analogy, the worker nodes in the cluster are ships that can load containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But somebody needs to load the containers on the ships and not just load plan how to load identify the\n",
    "\n",
    "right ships store information about the ships monitor and track the location of containers on the ships\n",
    "\n",
    "manage the whole loading process etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by the control ships that host different offices and departments monitoring equipments\n",
    "\n",
    "communication equipments cranes for moving containers between ships etc. The control ships relate to\n",
    "\n",
    "the master node in the Kubernetes cluster the master node is responsible for managing the Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster storing information regarding the different nodes planning which containers cause where monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "the notes and containers on them etc. The Master node does all of these using a set of components together\n",
    "\n",
    "known as the control plane components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at each of these components now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are many containers being loaded and unloaded from the ships on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so you need to maintain information about the different ships what container is on which ship and\n",
    "\n",
    "what time it was loaded etc. All of these are stored in a highly available key value store known as\n",
    "\n",
    "Etcd the Etcd is a database that stores information in a key-value format.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look more into what Etcd cluster actually is what data is stored in it and how it stores the\n",
    "\n",
    "data in one of the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "When ships arrive you load containers on them using cranes the cranes identify the containers that need\n",
    "\n",
    "to be placed on ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "It identifies the right ship based on its size its capacity the number of containers already on the\n",
    "\n",
    "ship and any other conditions such as the destination of the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of containers it is allowed to carry etc. So those are schedulers in a Kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "as scheduler identifies the right note to place a container on based on the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource requirements the worker nodes capacity or any other policies or constraints such as tents and\n",
    "\n",
    "tolerations or node affinity rules that are on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at these in much more detail with examples and practice tests later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a whole section on scheduling alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different offices in the dock that are assigned to special tasks or departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the operations team takes care of ship handling traffic control etc. they deal with issues\n",
    "\n",
    "related to damages the routes the different ship state etc. The cargo team takes care of containers\n",
    "\n",
    "when continuous are damaged or destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "They make sure new containers are made available.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have these services office that takes care of the I.T. and communications between different ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in Kubernetes we have controllers available that take care of different areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The node-controller takes care of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're responsible for onboarding new nodes to\n",
    "\n",
    "the cluster handling situations where nodes become unavailable or get gets destroyed and the replication\n",
    "\n",
    "controller ensures that the desired number of containers are running at all times in your replication\n",
    "\n",
    "group.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have seen different components like the different offices the different ships the data store the\n",
    "\n",
    "cranes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do these communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does one office reach the other office and who manages them all at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-apiserver is the primary management component of kubernetes. The kube-api server is responsible for\n",
    "\n",
    "orchestrating all operations within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It exposes the Kubernetes API which is used by externals users to perform management operations on\n",
    "\n",
    "the cluster as well as the various controllers to monitor the state of the cluster and make the necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "changes as required and by the worker nodes to communicate with the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are working with containers here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are everywhere so we need everything to be container compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our applications are in the form of containers the different components that form the entire management\n",
    "\n",
    "system.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the master nodes could be hosted in the form of containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNS service networking solution can all be deployed in the form of containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need these software that can run containers and that's the container runtime engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular one being Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need Docker or it's supported equivalent installed on all the nodes in the cluster including the\n",
    "\n",
    "master nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "if you wish to host the control plane components as containers. Now it doesn’t always have to be Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes supports other run time engines as well like ContainerD or Rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "let's now turn our focus onto the cargo ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now every ship has a captain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The captain is responsible for managing all activities on these ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The captain is responsible for liaising with the master ships starting with letting the master ship\n",
    "\n",
    "know that they are interested in joining the group receiving information about the containers to be\n",
    "\n",
    "loaded on the ship and loading the appropriate containers as required sending reports back to the master\n",
    "\n",
    "about the status of this ship and the status of the containers on the ship etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the captain of the ship is the kubelet in Kubernetes. A kubelet is an agent that runs on\n",
    "\n",
    "each node in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It listens for instructions from the kube-api server and deploys or destroys containers on the nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-api server periodically fetches status reports from the kubelet to monitor the state of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "and containers on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubelet was more of a captain on the ship that manages containers on the ship. But the applications\n",
    "\n",
    "running on the worker notes need to be able to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example you might have a web server running in one container on one of the nodes and a database\n",
    "\n",
    "server running on another container.\n",
    "\n",
    "on another node. How would the web server reach the database server on the other node\n",
    "\n",
    "Communication between worker nodes are enabled by another component that runs on the worker node known\n",
    "\n",
    "as the Kube-proxy service. The Kube-proxy service ensures that the necessary rules are in place on the\n",
    "\n",
    "worker nodes to allow the containers running on them to reach each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to summarize we have master and worker nodes on the master.\n",
    "\n",
    "we have the ETCD cluster which stores information about the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "we have the Kube scheduler that is responsible for scheduling applications or containers on Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "We have different controllers that take care of different functions like the node control, replication,\n",
    "\n",
    "controller etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "we have the Kube api server that is responsible for orchestrating all operations within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "on the worker node.\n",
    "\n",
    "we have the kubelet that listens for instructions from the Kube-apiserver and manages containers and\n",
    "\n",
    "the kube-proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "That helps in enabling communication between services within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's a high level overview of the various components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will drill down into each of these in the upcoming lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for now and I will see you in the next lecture.\n",

    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298420#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quick introduction to ETCD for beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already know about ETCD, feel free to skip and head over to the next video where we\n",
    "\n",
    "discuss about ETCD in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "we start with a basic introduction to what a key-value store is and how it is different from traditional\n",
    "\n",
    "databases. How to quickly get started with ETCD and how to use the client tool to operate ETCD. Later in this\n",
    "\n",
    "course\n",
    "\n",
    "when we cover high availability we will discuss about what it means to be a distributed system how ETCD\n",
    "\n",
    "works in a cluster mode, what RAFT protocol is and what is the best practices around the number of\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes in an ETCD cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is ETCD\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a distributed reliable key value store that is simple secure and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's break it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a key value store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally databases have been in a tabular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have heard about sequel or relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "They store data in the form of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example here is a table that stores information regarding few individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The row represents each person and the column represents the type of information being stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now say we want to add additional details about these individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example salary so we add an additional column doing so impacts the entire table and all of the\n",
    "\n",
    "individuals in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then add salary details to this column.\n",
    "\n",
    "However not all of them are working.\n",
    "\n",
    "So those cells remain empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are then required to store great information so we add a new column and update these students with\n",
    "\n",
    "their respective grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again only students have grades so the corresponding fields for adults are empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time a new information needs to be added the entire table is affected and leads to a lot of empty\n",
    "\n",
    "cells. A key-value store stores information in the form of documents or pages so each individual gets\n",
    "\n",
    "a document and all information about that individual is stored within that file these files can be in\n",
    "\n",
    "any format or structure and changes to one file does not affect the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The working individuals can have their files with salary fields and the students can have their pages\n",
    "\n",
    "with grades only you can add additional details to any of these documents without having to update other\n",
    "\n",
    "similar documents while you could store and retrieve simple key and values when your data gets complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically end up transacting in data formats like JSON or YAML it's easy to install and get started\n",
    "\n",
    "with ETCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the binary extract and run download all relevant binary of For Your operating system from the\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub releases pages extracted and run the ETCD executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run ETCD it starts a service that listens on port 2379 by default. You can then attach\n",
    "\n",
    "any clients to the ETCD service to store and retrieve information. A default\n",
    "\n",
    "client that comes with ETCD is the ETCD control client\n",
    "\n",
    "The etcdctl is a command line client for ETCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it to store and retrieve key-value pairs to store a key-value pair run the etcdctl\n",
    "\n",
    "set key1 command followed by the value value one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates an entry in the database with the information to retrieve the stored data run the etcdctl\n",
    "\n",
    "get key1 command. To view more options run the etcdctl command without any arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's a quick introduction to ETCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will see how ETCD works in Kubernetes. And later in this course, we will discuss more about\n",
    "\n",
    "configuring ETCD clusters in a High Availability setup and the best practices around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. ETCD in Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298422#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in the previous lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "we discussed the basics of ETCD. In this\n",
    "\n",
    "lecture we will talk about ETCD’s role in kubernetes. The ETCD datastore stores information regarding the\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster such as the nodes, pods, configs, secrets, accounts, roles, bindings and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every information you see when you run the kubectl get command is from the ETCD server. Every change\n",
    "\n",
    "you make to your cluster, such as adding additional nodes, deploying pods or replica sets are updated\n",
    "\n",
    "in the ETCD server. Only once it is updated in the ETCD server, is the change considered to be complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how you setup your cluster, ETCD is deployed differently. Throughout this section we discuss\n",
    "\n",
    "about two types of kubernetes deployment. One deployed from scratch and other using kubeadm tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice test environments are deployed using the kubeadm tool and later in this course when\n",
    "\n",
    "we set up a cluster we set it up from scratch so it's good to know the difference between the two methods\n",
    "\n",
    "if you set up your cluster from scratch then you deploy ETCD by downloading the ETCD binaries yourself,\n",
    "\n",
    "installing the binaries and configuring ETCD as a service in your master node yourself. There are many\n",
    "\n",
    "options passed into the service a number of them relate to certificates we will learn more about these\n",
    "\n",
    "certificates how to create them and how to configure them later in this course we have a whole section\n",
    "\n",
    "on TLS certificates. The others are about configuring ETCD as a cluster. We will look at those options\n",
    "\n",
    "when we set up high availability in kubernetes the only option to note for now is the advertised client\n",
    "\n",
    "url.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the address on which ETCD listens. It happens to be on the IP of the server and on port\n",
    "\n",
    "2379, which is the default port on which etcd listens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the URL that should be configured on the kube-api server when it tries to reach the etcd server.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you setup your cluster using kubeadm then kubeadm deploys the ETCD server for you as a POD in\n",
    "\n",
    "the kube-system namespace. You can explore the etcd database using the etcdctl utility within this\n",
    "\n",
    "pod. To list all keys stored by kubernetes, run the etcdctl get command like this. Kubernetes stores\n",
    "\n",
    "data in the specific directory structure the root directory is a registry and under that you have the\n",
    "\n",
    "various kubernetes constructs such as minions or nodes, pods, replicasets, deployments etc. In a\n",
    "\n",
    "high availability environment you will have multiple master nodes in your cluster then you will have\n",
    "\n",
    "multiple ETCD instances spread across the master nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, make sure to specify the ETCD instances know about each other by setting the right parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "in the ETCD service configuration. The initial-cluster option is where you must specify the different\n",
    "\n",
    "instances of the ETCD service.\n",
    "\n",
    "We talk about high availability in much more detail later in this course but I thought its worth while\n",
    "\n",
    "to point it out here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that's it for this lecture and I will see you in the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Kube-API Server\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298426#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will talk about the Kube-API server in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we discussed that the Kube-api server is the primary management component in kubernetes. When\n",
    "\n",
    "you run a kubectl command, the kubectl utility is infact reaching to the kube-apiserver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-api server first authenticates the request and validates it. It then retrieves the data from the\n",
    "\n",
    "ETCD cluster and responds back with the requested information.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t really need to use the kubectl command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you could also invoke the API directly by sending a post request like this let's look at an\n",
    "\n",
    "example of creating a pod when you do that as before the request is authenticated first and then validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the API server creates a POD object without assigning it to a node, updates the information\n",
    "\n",
    "in the ETCD server updates the user that the POD has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler continuously monitors the API server and realizes that there is a new pod with no node\n",
    "\n",
    "assigned the scheduler identifies the right node to place the new POD on and communicates that back\n",
    "\n",
    "to the kube-apiserver.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API server then updates the information in the ETCD cluster. The API server then passes that information\n",
    "\n",
    "to the kubelet in appropriate worker node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubelet then creates the POD on the node and instructs the container runtime engine to deploy the\n",
    "\n",
    "application image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, the kubelet updates the status back to the API server and the API server then updates the\n",
    "\n",
    "data back in the ETCD cluster. A similar pattern is followed every time a change is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-apiserver is at the center of all the different tasks that needs to be performed to make a\n",
    "\n",
    "change in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the kube-api server is responsible for Authenticating and validating requests, retrieving\n",
    "\n",
    "and updating data in ETCD data store,\n",
    "\n",
    "in fact, kube-api server is the only component that interacts directly with the etcd datastore.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other components such as the scheduler, kube-controller-manager & kubelet\n",
    "\n",
    "uses the API server to perform updates in the cluster in their respective areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you bootstrapped your cluster using kubeadm tool then you don't need to know this but if you are\n",
    "\n",
    "setting up the hard way, then kube-apiserver is available as a binary in the kubernetes release\n",
    "\n",
    "page. Download it and configure it to run as a service on your kubernetes master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kube-api server is run with a lot of parameters as you can see here. Throughout this section\n",
    "\n",
    "we are going to take a peak at how to install and configure these individual components of the kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to understand all of the options right now but I think having a high level understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "on some of these now will make it easier later when we configure the whole cluster and all of its components\n",
    "\n",
    "from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubernetes architecture consists of a lot of different components working with each other, talking\n",
    "\n",
    "to each other in many different ways so they all need to know where the other components are.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different modes of authentication, authorization, encryption and security. And that’s why you\n",
    "\n",
    "have so many options when we go through the relevant section in the course we will pull up this file\n",
    "\n",
    "and look at the relevant options.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will look at a few important ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of them are certificates that are used to secure the connectivity between different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at these certificates in more detail when we go through the SSL/TLS certificates lecture later\n",
    "\n",
    "in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a whole section just for it. So we will get rid of them for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just remember all of the various components we are going to look at in this section will have certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "associated with them. The option ETCD-servers is where you specify the location of the ETCD servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the kube-api server connects to the etcd servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you view the kube-api server options in an existing cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on how you set up your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    ". If you set it up with kubeadm tool, kubeadm deploys the kube-api server as a pod in the kube-\n",
    "\n",
    "system namespace on the master node you can see the options within the pod definition file located at\n",
    "\n",
    "etc kubernetes manifests folder. etc kubernetes manifests folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-apiserver service located at /etc/systemd/system/kube-apiserver.service.You can also see\n",
    "\n",
    "the running process and the effective options by listing the process on the master node and searching\n",
    "\n",
    "for kube-apiserver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",

    "## 10. Kube Controller Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298428#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will talk about Kube Controller Manager. As we discussed earlier, the kube controller manager manages\n",
    "\n",
    "various controllers in Kubernetes. A controller is like an office or department within the master ship\n",
    "\n",
    "that have their own set of responsibilities. Such as an office for the Ships would be responsible for\n",
    "\n",
    "monitoring and taking necessary actions about the ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a new ship arrives or when a ship leaves or gets destroyed another office could be one that\n",
    "\n",
    "manages the containers on the ships they take care of containers that are damaged or full of ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these officers are number 1, continuously on the lookout for the status of the ships and 2, take\n",
    "\n",
    "necessary actions to remediate the situation. In the kubernetes terms\n",
    "\n",
    "a controller is a process that continuously monitors the state of various components within the system\n",
    "\n",
    "and works towards bringing the whole system to the desired functioning state.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the node controller is responsible for monitoring the status of the nodes and taking necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "actions to keep the application running.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does that through the kube-api server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The node controller checks the status of the nodes every 5 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way the node controller can monitor the health of the nodes if it stops receiving heartbeat from\n",
    "\n",
    "a node the node is marked as unreachable but it waits for 40 seconds before marking it unreachable after\n",
    "\n",
    "a node is marked unreachable it gives it five minutes to come back up if it doesn’t, it removes the\n",
    "\n",
    "PODs assigned to that node and provisions them on the healthy ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the PODs are part of a replica set the next controller is the replication controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is responsible for monitoring the status of replica sets and ensuring that the desired number of\n",
    "\n",
    "PODs are available at all times within the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a pod dies it creates another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now those were just two examples of controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more such controllers available within kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever concepts we have seen so far in kubernetes such as deployments, Services, namespaces,\n",
    "\n",
    "persistent volumes and whatever intelligence is built into these constructs it is implemented through\n",
    "\n",
    "these various controllers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine this is kind of the brain behind a lot of things in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how do you see these controllers and where are they located in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're all packaged into a single process known as kubernetes controller manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install the kubernetes controller manager the different controllers get installed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you install and view the kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Controller manager download the kube-controller-manager from the kubernetes release page. Extract it and\n",
    "\n",
    "run it as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run it as you can see there are a list of options provided this is where you provide additional\n",
    "\n",
    "options to customize your controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember some of the default settings for node controller we discussed earlier such as the node monitor\n",
    "\n",
    "period the grace period and the eviction timeout.\n",
    "\n",
    "These go in here as options.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an additional option called controllers that you can use to specify which controllers to enable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default\n",
    "\n",
    "all of them are enabled but you can choose to enable a select few.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in case any of your controllers don't seem to work or exist this would be a good starting point to\n",
    "\n",
    "look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you view the Kube-controller-manager server options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again it depends on how you set up your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set it up with kubeadm tool, kubeadm deploys the kube-controller-manager as a pod in the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-system namespace on the master node. You can see the options within the pod definition file located\n",
    "\n",
    "at etc kubernetes manifests folder. In a non-kubeadm setup, you can inspect the options by viewing\n",
    "\n",
    "the kube-controller-manager service located at the services directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see the running process and the effective options by listing the process on the master\n",
    "\n",
    "node and searching for kube-controller-manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture and I will see you in the next.\n",

    "## 11. Kube Scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298430#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "we will talk about Kube Scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we discussed that the kubernetes scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods on nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now don't let the graphic mislead you.\n",
    "\n",
    "remember the scheduler is only responsible for deciding which pod goes on which node. It doesn’t actually\n",
    "\n",
    "place the pod on the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s the job of the kubelet. The kubelet or the captain on the ship is who creates the pod on the\n",
    "\n",
    "ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler only decides which pod goes where.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how the scheduler does that in a bit more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all why do you need a scheduler? When there are many ships and many containers,\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to make sure that the right container ends up on the right ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example there could be different sizes of ships and containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to make sure the ship has sufficient capacity to accommodate those containers different ships\n",
    "\n",
    "maybe going to different destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to make sure your containers are placed on the right ships so they end up in the right destination\n",
    "\n",
    "In kubernetes, the scheduler decides which nodes the pods are placed on\n",
    "\n",
    "depending on certain criteria. You may have PODs with different resource requirements,\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have nodes in the cluster dedicated to certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the scheduler assign these PODs? The scheduler looks at each POD and tries to find the\n",
    "\n",
    "best node for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let’s take one of these PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big blue one. It has a set of CPU and Memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler goes through two phases to identify the best node for the pod in the first phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler tries to filter out the nodes that do not fit the profile for this pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the nodes that do not have sufficient CPU and memory resources requested by the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the first two small nodes are filtered out. So we are now left with two nodes on which the POD\n",
    "\n",
    "can be placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how does the scheduler pick one from the two the scheduler ranks the node to identify the best fit\n",
    "\n",
    "for the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a priority function to assign a score to the nodes on a scale of 0 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the scheduler calculates the amount of resources that would be free on the nodes after placing\n",
    "\n",
    "the pod on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the one on the right would have 6 CPUs free if the pod was placed on it which is 4 more\n",
    "\n",
    "than the other one so it gets a better rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so it wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's how a scheduler works at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course these can be customized and you can write your own scheduler as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more topics to look at such as resource requirements, limits, taints and tolerations,\n",
    "\n",
    "node selectors, affinity rules etc. Which is why we have an entire section dedicated to scheduling coming\n",
    "\n",
    "up in this course where we will discuss each of these in much more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will continue to focus on the scheduler as a process at a high level.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you install the kube-scheduler?\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the kube-scheduler from the kubernetes release page. Extract it and run it as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "when you run it as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "You specify the scheduler configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you view the kube-scheduler server options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, if you set it up with kubeadm tool, kubeadm deploys the kube-scheduler as a pod\n",
    "\n",
    "in the kube-system namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "on the master node. You can see the options within the pod definition file located at etc\n",
    "\n",
    "kubernetes manifests folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see the running process and the effective options by listing the process on the master\n",
    "\n",
    "node and searching for kube-scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will see you in the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Kubelet\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298432#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will look at kubelet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we discussed that the kubelet is like the captain on the ship. They lead all activities on\n",
    "\n",
    "a ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're the ones responsible for doing all the paperwork necessary to become part of the cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "They're the sole point of contact from the master ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "They load or unload containers on the ship as instructed by the scheduler on the master.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also send back reports at regular intervals on the status of the ship and the containers on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubelet in the kubernetes worker node, registers the node with the kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it receives instructions to load a container or a POD on the node, it requests the container run time\n",
    "\n",
    "engine, which may be Docker, to pull the required image and run an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubelet then continues to monitor the state of the POD and the containers in it and reports to the kube-api\n",
    "\n",
    "server on a timely basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you install the kubelet? If you use kubeadm tool to deploy your cluster, it does not\n",
    "\n",
    "automatically deploy the kubelet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that's the difference from the other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must always manually install the kubelet on your worker nodes. Download the installer, extract\n",
    "\n",
    "it and run it as a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the running kubelet process and the effective options by listing the process on the worker\n",
    "\n",
    "node and searching for kubelet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look more into kubelets, how to configure kubelets, generate certificates, and finally how\n",
    "\n",
    "to TLS bootstrap kubelets later in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will see you in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Kube Proxy\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298434#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture, we will talk about Kube Proxy. Within a kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster every pod can reach every other pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is accomplished by deploying a POD networking solution to the cluster. A POD network is an internal\n",
    "\n",
    "virtual network that spans across all the nodes in the cluster to which all the PODs connect to. Through this\n",
    "\n",
    "network are able to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many solutions available for deploying such a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case I have a web application deployed on the first node and a database application deployed\n",
    "\n",
    "on the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web app can reach the database, simply by using the IP of the database POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is no guarantee that the IP of the database part will always remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've gone through the lecture on services as discussed in the beginners course you must know that\n",
    "\n",
    "a better way for the web application to access the database is using a service. So we create a service\n",
    "\n",
    "to expose the database application across the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web application can now access the database using the name of the service db.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service also gets an IP address assigned to it whenever a pod tries to reach the service using its\n",
    "\n",
    "IP or name it forwards the traffic to the back end pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is this service and how does it get an IP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the service join the same POD Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "The service cannot join the pod network because the service is not an actual thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not a container like pod so it doesn't have any interfaces or an actively listening process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a virtual component that only lives in the cabinet as memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then we also said that the service should be accessible across the cluster from any not.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is that achieved?\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where kube-proxy comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kube-proxy is a process that runs on each node in the kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its job is to look for new services and every time a new service is created it creates the appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "rules on each node to forward traffic to those services to the backend pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way it does this is using IPTABLES rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it creates an IP tables rule on each node in the cluster to forward traffic heading to\n",
    "\n",
    "the IP of the service which is 10.96.0.12 to the IP of the actual pod which is\n",
    "\n",
    "10.32.0.15. So how kube-proxy configure the service\n",
    "\n",
    "We discuss a lot more about networking and services kube-proxy and POD networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later in this course again we have a large section just for networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a high level overview for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see how to install kube-proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the kube-proxy binary from the kubernetes release page. Extract it and run it as a service. The\n",
    "\n",
    "kubeadm tool deploys kube-proxy as PODs on each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact it is deployed as a daemon set, so a single POD is always deployed on each node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well if you don't know about daemon set yet don't worry we have a lecture on that coming up in this\n",
    "\n",
    "course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now covered a high-level overview of the various components in the kubernetes control plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned we will look at some of these in much more detail at various sections in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will see you in the next section.\n",

    "## 14. Recap - PODs\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14298578#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on Kubernetes PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on Kubernetes PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we head into understanding PODS, we would like to assume that the following have been set up already.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point,\n",
    "\n",
    "we assume that the application is already developed and built into Docker Images and it is availalble\n",
    "\n",
    "on a Docker repository like Docker hub,\n",
    "\n",
    "so kubernetes can pull it down.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assume that the Kubernetes cluster has already been setup and is working.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be a single-node setup or a multi-node setup,\n",
    "\n",
    "doesn’t matter. All the services need to be in a running state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed before, with kubernetes our ultimate aim is to deploy our application in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "of containers on a set of machines that are configured as worker nodes in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, kubernetes does not deploy containers directly on the worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The containers are encapsulated into a Kubernetes object known as PODs. A POD is a single instance of\n",
    "\n",
    "an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A POD is the smallest object, that you can create in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see the simplest of simplest cases were you have a single node kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "with a single instance of your application running in a single docker container encapsulated in a POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the number of users accessing your application increase and you need to scale your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to add additional instances of your web application to share the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, were would you spin up additional instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we bring up a new container instance within the same POD?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create new POD altogether with a new instance of the same application. As you can see\n",
    "\n",
    "we now have two instances of our web application running on two separate PODs on the same kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "system or node.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the user base further increases and your current node has no sufficient capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well then you can always deploy additional PODs on a new node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have a new node added to the cluster to expand the clusters physical capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what I am trying to illustrate in this slide is that PODs usually have a one to one relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "with containers running your application. To scale up\n",
    "\n",
    "you create new PODs and to scale down you delete existing PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not add additional containers to an existing pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "to scale your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also if you're wondering how we implement all of this and how we achieve load balancing between the\n",
    "\n",
    "containers etc we will get into all of that in a later lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we are only trying to understand the basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just said that pods usually have a one to one relationship with the containers but are we restricted\n",
    "\n",
    "to having a single container in a single POD?\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single pod can have multiple containers except for the fact that they're usually not multiple containers\n",
    "\n",
    "of the same kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the previous slide if our intention was to scale our application then we would need\n",
    "\n",
    "to create additional PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes you might have a scenario were you have a helper container that might be doing some kind\n",
    "\n",
    "of supporting task for our web application such as processing a user entered data processing a file uploaded\n",
    "\n",
    "by the user etc. and you want these helper containers to live alongside your application container.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case you can have both of these containers part of the same pod so that when a new application\n",
    "\n",
    "container is created. The helper is also created and when it dies the helper also dies.\n",
    "\n",
    "since they are part of the same POD. The two containers can also communicate with each other directly\n",
    "\n",
    "by referring to each other as ‘localhost’ since they share the same network namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus they can easily share the same storage space as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you still have doubts in this topic. I would understand if you did because, I did the first time, I\n",
    "\n",

    "Let’s, for a moment, keep kubernetes out of our discussion and talk about simple docker containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume we were developing a process or a script to deploy our application on a docker host. Then\n",
    "\n",
    "we would first simply deploy our application using a simple docker run python-app command\n",
    "\n",
    "and the application runs fine and our users are able to access it. When the load increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "we deploy more instances of our application by running the docker run commands many more times.\n",

    "\n",
    "We now have a new helper container that helps our web application by processing or fitting data from\n",

    "\n",
    "These helper containers maintain a one-to-one relationship with our application container and thus,\n",
    "\n",
    "needs to communicate the application containers directly and access data from those containers. For this\n",
    "\n",
    "we need to maintain a map of what app and help our containers are connected to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would need to establish network connectivity between these containers ourselves using links and custom\n",
    "\n",
    "networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "we would need to create shareable volumes and share it among the containers\n",
    "\n",
    "We would need to maintain a map of that as well. And most importantly we would need to monitor the state\n",
    "\n",
    "of the application container and when it dies manually kill the helper container as well as it's no\n",
    "\n",
    "longer required.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new container is deployed we would need to deploy the new helper container as well. With PODs,\n",
    "\n",
    "kubernetes does all of this for us automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just need to define what containers a POD consists of and the containers in a POD by default will\n",
    "\n",
    "have access to the same storage, the same network namespace, and same fate as in they will be created\n",
    "\n",
    "together and destroyed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if our application didn’t happen to be so complex and we could live with a single container, kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "still requires you to create PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is good in the long run as your application is now equipped for architectural changes and scale\n",

    "\n",
    "Earlier we learned about the kubectl run command.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this command really does is it deploys a docker container by creating a POD. So it first creates\n",
    "\n",
    "a POD automatically and deploys an instance of the nginx docker image.\n",
    "\n",
    "But were does it get the application image from?\n",
    "\n",
    "For that you need to specify the image name using the -- image parameter. The application image,\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case the nginx image, is downloaded from the docker hub repository. Docker hub\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed is a public repository where latest Docker images of various applications are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could configure kubernetes to pull the image from the public docker hub or a private repository\n",
    "\n",
    "within the organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a POD created, how do we see the list of PODs available?\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubectl get PODs command helps us see the list of pods in our cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we see the part is in the container creating state and soon changes to a running state\n",
    "\n",
    "when it is actually running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember that we haven’t really talked about the concepts on how a user can access the nginx\n",
    "\n",
    "web server.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so in the current state we haven’t made the web server accessible to external users.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can however access it internally from the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now we will just see how to deploy a POD and in a later lecture\n",

    "So we will set it as part of some other possible values here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could be replica set or deployment or service which is what you see in the kind field in the table on\n",
    "\n",
    "the right the next is metadata the metadata is data about the object like its name labels etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see unlike the first two where you have specified a string value this is in the form of a\n",
    "\n",
    "dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "So everything under metadata is intended to the right a little bit and so names and labels are children\n",

    "later point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example there are hundreds of parts running a front end application and hundreds of parts running\n",

    "a back end application or a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will be difficult for you to group these parts once they are deployed.\n",

    "If you label them now as front end backend or database you will be able to filter the parts based on\n",
    "\n",
    "this label at a later point in time.\n",

    "a pod with a name.\n",

    "My app pod but we haven't really specified the container or image we need in the pod.\n",

    "This is where we would provide additional information to carbonate as pertaining to that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is going to be different for different objects so it's important to understand or refer to the\n",

    "documentation section to get the right format for each since we are only creating a pod with a single\n",
    "\n",
    "container in it.\n",

    "It is easy spec is a dictionary so add a property under it called containers containers is a list or\n",

    "tips and tricks around using this idea which will make your life a developing Cuban it is to finish\n",
    "\n",
    "in files enamel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are ways that you can.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plugins that will help you validate your file available with a pie chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we look at those as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to start with I'm going to create a new project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to call it as part and I'm just going to create the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's that's my folder named part and under part I'm going to start by creating a pod definition\n",
    "\n",
    "file.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to name that part that dash definition dot Jamel.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so now I have a one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as we saw in the lecture every component is definition file has the four root level properties which\n",
    "\n",
    "are API version.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to specify each of those so we have API portion kind metadata and spec okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as we disclosed API version is going to be V1 for pod the kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know is pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to set that as pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata is an object or a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to hit enter and then I'm going to hit tab or you can actually use spaces as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to provide the properties unlimited data which are name.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I'm going to set a name for my part which is going to be my app dash pod and when I hit enter as\n",
    "\n",
    "you see it goes to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's intended it has equal number of spaces before it then the previous line.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I'm going to have labels and other labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "So since labels is a dictionary again I'm going to invent the next few lines to the right as well under\n",
    "\n",
    "labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have app and the name of the app is going to be my app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you look at this whole file and if you look at the bottom page chart has support for understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "ammo files.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you look at the bottom you can actually see the various elements in a tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as you can see document one of one indicates this file is in the entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "And under this file it it actually shows you in tree structure the various properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have API version which is directly under the File kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata and spec are all directly under the file or root properties of the file which is what we wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you look at V1 V1 is actually under API version so now as you can see under the document I have\n",
    "\n",
    "API version and under that I have V1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that matches what we're trying to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly if I select part you can see that it's under kind and if you select name which is under metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "you can see that it's under metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly when you select labels you will also see that it is under metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that means name and labels are children of metadata and theirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are siblings and they must be intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "They must have the same intonation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So under a name you have my app part so you can see the hierarchy there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly app is under labels and my app is under AB which is under labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you look at it name and labels need to be on the same vertical line for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I simply move labels to the right you now see that labels is under names and labels is now a child\n",
    "\n",
    "of name and which is not right it is supposed to be a sibling.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to remove those extra spaces I'm going to hit backspace and I'm going to level it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is right and under labels you can actually have as many labels as you want so you can create\n",
    "\n",
    "any key value pair here you can see cost center is our location north america or something like that\n",
    "\n",
    "type of this particular pod maybe a front end or something like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So anything that will help you group this particular part in the future for now I'm just going to remove\n",
    "\n",
    "all of that and I'll no move on to the specs section under the spec section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the specs section is unique to each object that you're creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for a pod under the spec section you actually have containers and under containers you have the containers\n",
    "\n",
    "is in fact an array or a list so you have a list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you need a each item in the list is identified by a dash so as you have to put a dash followed by\n",
    "\n",
    "space and then name which is the name of my pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorry the name of my container inside the pod and that's going to be in the next control container.\n",
    "\n",
    "And and then I have image which is the name of the image itself which is NTI and.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you look at it I have under spec I have containers which is a list and then I have an item in\n",
    "\n",
    "the list which is which has name and image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you try and look at the hierarchy of what we just created say if I select Name I see that it's\n",
    "\n",
    "under spec and it's under containers but there's something in between it says item once one of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "What that actually means is that's what indicates that the container is a list and it has multiple items\n",
    "\n",
    "and this is the first item of just one item.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these two lines is one item in the containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly you can have we know that we discussed that you can have additional containers in a port so\n",
    "\n",
    "if you had additional containers then this is how you would define it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would in the new line you would add a new dash followed by new information about the way followed\n",
    "\n",
    "by information about the new port which could be like a back and container and the image is could be\n",
    "\n",
    "something like Redis or something.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case now when it's like name you can actually see that it says item two or two and then one\n",
    "\n",
    "of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now it actually identifies each item in the array or the list so that indicates that the format is\n",
    "\n",
    "correct and that is what we were trying to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm just gonna get rid of the second container and I'm going to leave it as one can report.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this is good.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm now going to copy this the contents of this and create an actual port using this the content that\n",
    "\n",
    "we just created.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to go to the cube master.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to create a a folder structure for my demos.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to call it demos and under demos I'm going to create a folder called pod and under part I'm\n",
    "\n",
    "going to create a file named pod definition dot Jamil\n",
    "\n",
    "and I will paste the contents that I just created\n",
    "\n",
    "OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when I know I'm going verify the contents of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "I can now run the cube control get parts command before I create the port I just want to make sure there's\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing running.\n",

    "So if you're following me from the previous lab where I deployed a port using the cube control run command.\n",

    "Controllers are the brains behind Cuban interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are the processes that monitor Cuban natives objects and respond accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will discuss about one controller in particular and that is the replication controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a replica and why do we need a replication controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to our first scenario where we had a single pod running our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if for some reason our application crashes and the pod fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users will no longer be able to access our application to prevent users from losing access to our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to have more than one instance or pod running at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way if one failed we still have our application running on the other one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replication controller helps us run multiple instances of a single pod in the cabinet as cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "thus providing high availability so does that mean you can't use a replication controller if you plan\n",
    "\n",
    "to have a single pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you have a single pod the replication controller can help by automatically bringing up a new\n",
    "\n",
    "pod when the existing one fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the replication controller ensures that the specified number of parts are running at all times\n",
    "\n",
    "even if it's just one or 100 another reason we need a replication controller is to create multiple paths\n",
    "\n",
    "to share the load across them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in this simple scenario we have a single pod serving a set of users when the number of users\n",
    "\n",
    "increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "We deploy additional pod to balance the load across the two parts if the demand further increases and\n",
    "\n",
    "if we were to run out of resources on the first node we could deploy additional pods across the other\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the replication controller spans across multiple nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps us balance the load across multiple paths on different nodes as well as scale our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the demand increases it's important to note that there are two similar terms replication controller\n",
    "\n",
    "and replay cassette.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both have the same purpose but they're not the same replication controller is the older technology that\n",
    "\n",
    "is being replaced by replicate set properly has said is the new recommended way to setup replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "However whatever we discussed in the previous few slides remain applicable to both these technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are minor differences in the way each works and we will look at that in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such we will try to stick to replicable sets in all of our demos and implementations going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now look at how we create a replication controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the previous lecture we start by creating a replication controller definition file we will name\n",
    "\n",
    "it our C dash to finish thought Jamil as with any Cuban Interest definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have four sections the API version kind metadata and spec the API version is specific to what we\n",
    "\n",
    "are creating in this case replication controller is supported in Coburn it is API version V1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will set it as v1 the kind as we know is a replication controller under a metadata we will add\n",
    "\n",
    "a name and we will call it my ab dash RC and we will also add a few labels app and type and assign values\n",
    "\n",
    "to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far it has been very similar to how we created a pod in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next is the most crucial part of the definition file and that is the specification written as spec\n",
    "\n",
    "for any Cuban it is definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spec section defines what's inside the object we are creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we know that the replication controller creates multiple instances of a part but what part\n",
    "\n",
    "we create a template section under spec to provide a part template to be used by the replication controller\n",
    "\n",
    "to create replicas now how do we define the part template.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not that hard because we have already done that in the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we created a pod definition file in the previous exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could reuse the contents of the file to populate the template section move all the contents of the\n",
    "\n",
    "pod definition file into the template section of the replication controller except for the first few\n",
    "\n",
    "lines which are API version and kind remember whatever we move must be under the template section meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "this should be intended to the right and have more spaces before them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the template line itself they should be children of the template section looking at our file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we now have two method metadata sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is for the replication controller and another for the pod and we have two aspects sections one for\n",
    "\n",
    "each.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have nested to definition files together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replication controller being the parent and the part definition being the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there is something still missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We haven't mentioned how many replicas we need in the replication controller for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add another property to the spec called replicas and input the number of replicas you need under it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the template and replicas are direct children of spec sections so they are siblings and\n",
    "\n",
    "must be on the same vertical line which means having equal number of spaces before them once the file\n",
    "\n",
    "is ready run the cubes GTL create command and input the file using the dash f parameter the replication\n",
    "\n",
    "controller is created when the replication controller is created it first creates the part using the\n",
    "\n",
    "part definition template as many as required which is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case to view the list of created replication controllers run the cube CDL get replication controller\n",
    "\n",
    "command and you will see the replication controller listed we can also see the desired number of friendly\n",
    "\n",
    "cars or parts the current number of friendly cars and how many of them are ready in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to see the parts that were created by the replication controller run the cube CDL\n",
    "\n",
    "get parts command and you will see three parts running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of them are starting with the name of the replication controller which is my ab dash RC\n",
    "\n",
    "indicating that they are all created automatically by the replication controller what we just saw was\n",
    "\n",
    "the replication controller let us now look at replica set it is very similar to replication controller\n",
    "\n",
    "as usual first we have API version kind metadata and spec the API version though is a bit different\n",
    "\n",
    "it is apps slash to be one which is different from what we had before for application controller which\n",
    "\n",
    "was just V1 if you get this wrong you are likely to get an error that looks like this it would say no\n",
    "\n",
    "match for kind replica set because the specified carbonates API version has no support for replica set\n",
    "\n",
    "the kind would be replicas set and we add name and labels in the metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "the specification section looks very similar to replication controller it has a template section where\n",
    "\n",
    "we provide part definition as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to copy the contents over from part definition file and we have number of replicas which\n",
    "\n",
    "is set to three.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there is one major difference between replication controller and replica set has set requires\n",
    "\n",
    "a selector definition the selector section helps the replica set identify what parts fall under it but\n",
    "\n",
    "why would you have to specify what parts fall under it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have provided the contents of the part definition file itself in the template it's because replicas\n",
    "\n",
    "set can also manage parts that were not created as part of the replica at creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example the reports created before the creation of the replica set that match labels specified\n",
    "\n",
    "in the selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replica set will also take those parts into consideration when creating the replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will elaborate this in the next slide but before we get into that I would like to mention that the\n",
    "\n",
    "selector is one of the major differences between replication controller and replica set the selector\n",
    "\n",
    "is not a required field in case of a replication controller but it is still available when you skip\n",
    "\n",
    "it as we did in the previous slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "It assumes it to be the same as the labels provided in the part definition file in case of replica said\n",
    "\n",
    "a user input is required for this property and it has to be written in the form of match labels as shown\n",
    "\n",
    "here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The match labeled selector simply matches the labels specified under it to the labels on the part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replica set selector also provides many other options for matching labels that were not available\n",
    "\n",
    "in the replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controller and as always to create a replica set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cube CTF and create command providing the definition file as input and to see the created replicas\n",
    "\n",
    "run the cubes TTL get replica set command to get list of parts simply run the cube control get parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Command.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the deal with labels and selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we label our parts and objects in corporate entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at a simple scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we deployed three instances of our front end web application as three part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to create a replication controller or replica set to ensure that we have three active\n",
    "\n",
    "parts at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes that is one of the use case of replica sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it to monitor existing parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have them already created as cities in this example in case they were not created the replica\n",
    "\n",
    "set will create them for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of the replica set is to monitor the parts and if any of them were to fail deploy new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replica set is in fact a process that monitors the parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how does the replica set.\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "What part to monitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be hundreds of other parts in the cluster running different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where labelling our parts during creation comes in handy we could now provide these labels as\n",
    "\n",
    "a filter for replica set under the selector section we use to match labels filter and provide the same\n",
    "\n",
    "label that we used while creating the parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the replica set knows which parts to monitor the same concept of labels and selectors is used\n",
    "\n",
    "in many other places throughout Cuba.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice now let me ask you a question along the same lines in the replica set specification section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that there are three sections template replicas and the selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need three replicas and we have updated our selector based on our discussion in the previous slide\n",
    "\n",
    "say for instance we have the same scenario as in the previous slide where we have three existing parts\n",
    "\n",
    "that were created already and we need to create a replica set to monitor the parts to ensure there are\n",
    "\n",
    "a minimum of three running at all times when the replication controller is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not going to deploy a new instance of part as three of them with matching labels are already created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case do we really need to provide a template section in the type replica set specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are not expecting the replica set to create a new port on deployment yes we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because in case one of the parts were to fail in the future the replicas that needs to create a new\n",
    "\n",
    "one to maintain the desired number of pods and for the replica set to create a new pod the template\n",
    "\n",
    "definition section is required let's now look at how we scaled the replica set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we started with three replicas in the future we decided to scale to six.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we update our replica set to scale to six replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well there are multiple ways to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is to update the number of replicas in the definition file to 6\n",
    "\n",
    "then run the cubes TTL replace command to specify the same file using the dash f parameter and that\n",
    "\n",
    "will update the replica set to have six replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to do it is to run the cube control scale command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the replicas parameter to provide the new number of replicas and specify the same file as input\n",
    "\n",
    "human either input the definition file or provide the Republicans at name in the type name format however\n",
    "\n",
    "remember that using the file name as input will not result in the number of replicas being updated automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words the number of friendly cars in the replica set definition file will still be three even\n",
    "\n",
    "though you scaled your replica set to have six replicas using the cube control scale command and the\n",
    "\n",
    "file as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also options available for automatically scaling the replica set based on load but that is\n",
    "\n",
    "an advanced topic and we will discuss it at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now review the commands real quick the cube control create command as we know is used to create\n",
    "\n",
    "a replica set or basically any object in Cuba and it is depending on the file we are providing as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must provide the input file using the dash f parameter use the cube control get command to see List\n",
    "\n",
    "of replica sets created used to keep control delete replica set command followed by the name of the\n",
    "\n",
    "replica set to delete the replica set and then we have the cube controlled replace Command to replace\n",
    "\n",
    "or update the replica set and also the cube control scale command scale replica set simply from the\n",
    "\n",
    "command line without having to modify the file that's it for this lecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad Mannambeth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss about Kubernetes Deployments. For a minute,\n",
    "\n",
    "let us forget about PODs and replicasets and other kubernetes concepts and talk about how you might\n",
    "\n",
    "want to deploy your application in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example you have a web server that needs to be deployed in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need not one but many such instances of the web server running for obvious reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly whenever newer versions of application builds become available on the docker registry you would\n",
    "\n",
    "like to upgrade your Docker instances seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However when you upgrade your instances you do not want to upgrade all of them at once\n",
    "\n",
    "as we just did. This may impact users accessing our applications, so you might want to upgrade them one\n",
    "\n",
    "after the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that kind of upgrade is known as rolling updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose one of the upgrades you performed resulted in an unexpected error and you're asked to undo the\n",
    "\n",
    "recent change you would like to be able to roll back the changes that were recently carried out. Finally,\n",
    "\n",
    "say for example you would like to make multiple changes to your environment such as upgrading the underlying\n",
    "\n",
    "WebServer versions, as well as scaling your environment and also modifying the resource allocations etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "WebServer versions, as well as scaling your environment and also modifying the resource allocations etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not want to apply each change immediately after the command is run instead you would like to\n",
    "\n",
    "apply a pause to your environment, make the changes and then resume so that all changes are rolled-out\n",
    "\n",
    "together. All of these capabilities are available with the kubernetes Deployments. So far in this course\n",
    "\n",
    "we discussed about PODs, which deploy single instances of our application such as the web application\n",
    "\n",
    "in this case. Each container is encapsulated in PODs. Multiple such PODs are deployed using Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "Controllers or Replica Sets. And then comes Deployment which is a kubernetes object that comes higher\n",
    "\n",
    "in the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment provides us with the capability to upgrade the underlying instances seamlessly using\n",
    "\n",
    "rolling updates, undo changes, and pause and resume changes as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we create a deployment. As with the previous components,\n",
    "\n",
    "We first create a deployment definition file. The contents of the deployment definition file are exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "similar to the replica set definition file, except for the kind, which is now going to be deployment. If\n",
    "\n",
    "we walk through the contents of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "it has an apiVersion which is apps/v1, metadata which has name and labels and a spec that\n",
    "\n",
    "has template, replicas and selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The template has a pod definition inside it. Once the file is ready run the kubectl create command\n",
    "\n",
    "and specify the deployment definition file. Then run the kubectl get deployments command to see\n",
    "\n",
    "the newly created deployment. The deployment automatically creates a replica set.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you run the kubectl get replcaset command\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to see a new replica set in the name of the deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The replicasets ultimately create pods,\n",
    "\n",
    "so if you run the kubectl get pods command\n",
    "\n",
    "you will be able to see the pods with the name of the deployment and the replicaset.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far there hasn't been much of a difference between replica set and deployments except for the fact\n",
    "\n",
    "that deployments created a new kubernetes object called deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how to take advantage of the deployment using the use cases we discussed in the previous\n",
    "\n",
    "slide in the upcoming lectures and one more note before we end this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see all the created objects at once run the kubectl get all command and in this case we can\n",
    "\n",
    "see that the deployment was created and then we have the replica set followed by three pods that were\n",
    "\n",
    "created as part of the deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for this lecture.\n",

    "As you might have seen already, it is a bit difficult to create and edit YAML files. Especially in the CLI.

For example, if you were asked to create a pod or deployment with specific name and image you can simply run the kubectl run command.\n",

    "Each of these houses have their own set of rules that defines who does what each of these houses have\n",
    "\n",
    "their own set of resources that they can consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get back to kubernetes these houses correspond to namespaces in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this course we've created objects such as pods deployments and services in our cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever we have been doing we have been doing within a namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were inside a house all this while this namespace is known as the default namespace and it is created\n",
    "\n",
    "automatically kubernetes, when the cluster is first set up kubernetes, creates a set of pods\n",
    "\n",
    "and services for its internal purpose such as those required by the networking solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DNS service etc. to isolate these from the user and to prevent you from accidentally deleting or\n",
    "\n",
    "modifying these services kubernetes creates them under another namespace created at cluster startup\n",
    "\n",
    "named Kube system a third namespace created by Coburn that is automatically is called kube public.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where resources that should be made available to all users are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your environment is small or your learning and playing around with a small cluster you shouldn't\n",
    "\n",
    "really have to worry about namespaces you could continue to work in the default namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as and when you grow and use a kubernetes cluster for enterprise or production purposes you\n",
    "\n",
    "may want to consider the use of namespace as you can create your own namespaces as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you wanted to use the same cluster for both dev and production environment but at the\n",
    "\n",
    "same time isolate the resources between them you can create a different namespace for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way while working in the dev environment you don't accidentally modify a resources in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these namespace can have its own set of policies that define who can do what.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also assign quota of resources to each of these named spaces that we each namespace is guaranteed\n",
    "\n",
    "a certain amount and does not use more than it's allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit going back to the default namespace that we have been working on just like how the members within\n",
    "\n",
    "the House refer to each other by their first names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources within a namespace can refer to each other simply by their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the web app part can reach the db service simply using the hostname db service if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Web app Pod can reach a service in another namespace as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this you must append the name of the namespace to the name of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example for the web pod in the default namespace to connect to the database in the dev environment\n",
    "\n",
    "or namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the servicename.namespace.svc.cluste.local format that would be db service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dev.SVC.cluster.local you're able to do this because when the service is created a DNS entry\n",
    "\n",
    "is added automatically in this format looking closely at the DNS name of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part Cluster.local is the default domain name of the kubernetes cluster SVC is the subdomain\n",
    "\n",
    "for service followed by the namespace and then the name of the service itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now look at some of the operational aspects of namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a Kube control commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, this command is used to list all the pods but it only lists the pods in the default namespace\n",
    "\n",
    "to list pods in another namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the namespace option in the command along with the name of the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case Kube system here I have a pod definition file when you create a pod using this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pod is created in the default namespace to create a pod in another namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the namespace option if you want to make sure that this board gets created in the dev environment\n",
    "\n",
    "all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you don't specify the namespace in the command line you can move the namespace definition into\n",
    "\n",
    "the pod definition file like this under the metadata section.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good way to ensure your resources are always created in the same namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you create a new namespace like any other object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an namespace definition file the API version is V1 kind is namespace and under metadata specify\n",
    "\n",
    "the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dev run the Kube control create command to create the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to create a namespace is by simply running the command Kube control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create namespace followed by the name of the namespace now say we're working in three namespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed before by default we are in the default namespace which is why we can see the resources\n",
    "\n",
    "inside the default namespace using the kube control get pods command and to view those in the dev namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to use the namespace option but what if we want to switch to the dev namespace permanently so\n",
    "\n",
    "that we don't have to specify the namespace option anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, in that case, use the Kube control config command to set the namespace in the current context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dev you can then simply run the Kube control get pods command without the namespace option to list pods\n",
    "\n",
    "in the dev environment but you will need to specify the option for other environments such as default\n",
    "\n",
    "or prod similarly you can switch to the prod namespace the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally to view pods in all namespace use the all namespace option in the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will list all the pods in all of the namespace is taking a closer look at the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command first identifies the current context and then sets the namespace to the desired one for\n",
    "\n",
    "that current context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well contexts are used to manage multiple clusters in multiple environments from the same management\n",
    "\n",
    "system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a totally separate topic to discuss and requires its own lecture so we will discuss context in\n",
    "\n",
    "another lecture to limit resources in a namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a resource quota to create one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a definition file for resource quota specify the namespace for which you want to create the\n",
    "\n",
    "quota and then under spec provide your limits such as 10 pods 10 CPU units 10 GB byte of memory\n",
    "\n",
    "etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad Mannambeth. In this lecture we will discuss about Kubernetes Services. Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "Services enable communication between various components within and outside of the application. Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "services helps us connect applications together with other applications or users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example our application has groups of pods running various sections such as a group for serving\n",
    "\n",
    "front end load to users and other group for running back end processes and a third group connecting\n",
    "\n",
    "to an external data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is services that enable connectivity between these groups of pods services enable the front end\n",
    "\n",
    "application to be made available to end users it helps communication between back end and front end\n",
    "\n",
    "pods and helps in establishing connectivity to an external data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus services enable loose coupling between micro services in our application let's take a look at one\n",
    "\n",
    "use case of services.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we talked about how pods communicate with each other through internal networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some other aspects of networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture let's start with external communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we deployed our pod having a web application running on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we as an external user access the web page first of all let us look at the existing setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kubernetes Node has an IP address and that is 192.168.1.2. My laptop is\n",
    "\n",
    "on the same network as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "so it has an IP address 192.168.1.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internal POD network is in the range\n",
    "\n",
    "10.244.0.0 and the POD has an IP 10.244.0.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, I cannot ping or access the POD at address 10.244.0.2 as its in a separate network.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the options to see the webpage? First,\n",
    "\n",
    "if we were to SSH into the kubernetes node at 192.168.1.2, from the node, we would\n",
    "\n",
    "be able to access the POD’s webpage by doing a curl or if the node has a GUI, we could fire up a browser\n",
    "\n",
    "and see the webpage in a browser following the address http://10.244.0.2. But this is from inside\n",
    "\n",
    "the kubernetes Node and that’s not what I really want. I want to be able to access the web server\n",
    "\n",
    "from my own laptop without having to SSH into the node and simply by accessing the IP of the kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "node.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need something in the middle to help us map requests to the node from our laptop through the node\n",
    "\n",
    "to the POD running the web container.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the kubernetes service comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubernetes service is an object just like PODs, Replicasetor Deployments that we worked with\n",
    "\n",
    "before.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of its use case is to listen to a port on the Node and forward requests on that port to a port\n",
    "\n",
    "on the POD running the web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of service is known as a NodePortservice because the service listens to a port on the Node\n",
    "\n",
    "and forwards requests to PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other kinds of services available which we will now discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is what we discussed already.\n",
    "\n",
    "NodePortwere the service makes an internal POD accessible on a Port on the Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second is cluster IP.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in this case the service creates a virtual IP inside the cluster to enable communication between\n",
    "\n",
    "different services such as a set of front end servers to a set of back end servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third type is a LoadBalancer, were it provisions a load balancer for our service in supported cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good example of that would be to distribute load across the different web servers in your front end\n",
    "\n",
    "tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at each of these in a bit more detail along with some demos.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will discuss about the NodePortKubernetes Service.Getting back to NodePort,\n",
    "\n",
    "Few slides back.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed about external access to the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "We said that a Service can help us by mapping a port on the Node to a port on the POD. Let’s take a\n",
    "\n",
    "closer look at the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at it there are three ports involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The port on the POD were the actual web server is running is 80. And it is referred to as the targetPort\n",
    "\n",
    "because that is were the service forwards the requests to. The second port is the port on the service\n",
    "\n",
    "itself it is simply referred to as the port.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember these terms are from the viewpoint of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service is in fact like a virtual server inside the node inside the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has its own IP address and that IP address is called the cluster IP of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally we have the port on the node itself which we use to access the web server externally and\n",
    "\n",
    "that is known as the node port.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see it is 30008.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is because NodePorts can only be in a valid range which by default is from 30000 to\n",
    "\n",
    "32767.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now look at how to create the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how we created a Deployment, ReplicaSet or Pod, in the past we will use a definition file\n",
    "\n",
    "to create a service the high level structure of the file remains the same as before we have the API\n",
    "\n",
    "version kind\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata and specs sections the API version is going to be V1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kind is of course service the metadata will have a name and that will be the name of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can have labels but we don't need that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have spec and as always this is the most crucial part of the file and that is where we will\n",
    "\n",
    "be defining the actual services.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is the part of a definition file that differs between different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have spec and as always this is the most crucial part of the file as this is where we will be\n",
    "\n",
    "defining the actual services.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is the part of a definition file that differs between different objects in the spec section\n",
    "\n",
    "of a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have type and ports the type refers to the type of service we are creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed before it could be cluster IP node port or load balancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case since we are creating a node port we will set it has nodeport.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of a spec is ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we input information regarding what we discussed on the left side of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of port is the target port which we will set to 80 the next one is simply port which\n",
    "\n",
    "is a port on the service object and we will set that to 80 as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third is NodePort which we will set to 30008 or any number in the valid range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that out of these the only mandatory field is port if we don't provide a target port.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed to be the same as port.\n",
    "\n",
    "and if you don’t provide a nodePort a free port in the valid range between 30000 and\n",
    "\n",
    "32767 is automatically allocated. Also note that ports is an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "So no the dash under the port section that indicate the first element\n",
    "\n",
    "in the array. You can have multiple such port mappings within a single service. So we have all the information\n",
    "\n",
    "in\n",
    "\n",
    "but something is really missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing here in the definition file that connects the service to the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have simply specified the target port but we didn't mention the target port on which pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be 100s of other PODs with web services running on port 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we do that as we did with the replica sets previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "and a technique that you will see very often in kubernetes, we will use labels and selectors to link\n",
    "\n",
    "these together.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the POD was created with a label.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to bring that label into the service definition file so we have a new property in the spec section\n",
    "\n",
    "and that is called selector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in a replica set and deployment definition files under the selector provide a list of labels\n",
    "\n",
    "to identify the pod for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the pod definition file used to create the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull the labels from the pod definition file and place it under the selector section.\n",
    "\n",
    "This links the service to the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done create the service using the kubectlcreate command and input the service-definition file\n",
    "\n",
    "and there you have the service created. To see the created service, run the kubectlget services\n",
    "\n",
    "command that list the service the cluster IP and the map port.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type is node port as we created and the port on the node is set to 30008 because\n",
    "\n",
    "that's the port that we specified in the definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now use this port to access the web service using curl or a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "So curl to 192.168.1.2 which is the IP of the node and then use the port 30008\n",
    "\n",
    "to access the web server so far we talked about a service mapped to a single pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not the case all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "what do you do when you have multiple PODs? In a production environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You have multiple instances of your web application running for high availability and load balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "purposes in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have multiple similar pods running our web application they all have the same labels with a key\n",
    "\n",
    "app and set to a value of my app the same label is used as a selector during the creation of the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when the service is created it looks for a matching pod with the label and finds three of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service then automatically selects all the three pods as endpoints to forward the external requests\n",
    "\n",
    "coming from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to do any additional configuration to make this happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you're wondering what algorithm it uses to balance the load across the three different pods\n",
    "\n",
    "it uses a random algorithm does the service acts as a built in load balancer to distribute load across\n",
    "\n",
    "different pods and finally let us look at what happens when the pods are distributed across multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we have the web application on pods on separate nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a service without us having to do any additional configuration kubernetes automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a service that spans across all the nodes in the cluster and maps the target port to the same\n",
    "\n",
    "node port on all the nodes in the cluster this way you can access your application using the IP of any\n",
    "\n",
    "node in the cluster and using the same port number which in this case is 30008 as you\n",
    "\n",
    "can see using the IP of any of these nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I'm trying to curl to the same port and the same port is made available on all the nodes part of\n",
    "\n",
    "the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize in any case whether it be a single pod on a single node multiple pods on a single node\n",
    "\n",
    "or multiple pods on multiple nodes the service is created exactly the same without you having to do\n",
    "\n",
    "any additional steps during the service creation when pods are removed or added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The service is automatically updated making its highly flexible and adaptive once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't typically have to make any additional configuration changes that's it for this lecture and\n",
    "\n",
    "I will see you in the next lecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss about the Kubernetes Service -ClusterIP. A full stack web application typically has\n",
    "\n",
    "different kinds of pods hosting different parts of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have a number of pods running a front end web server another set of pods running a back end\n",
    "\n",
    "server, a set of PODs running a key-value store like Redis, another set of PODs running a persistent\n",
    "\n",
    "database like MySQL. The web front end server needs to communicate to the back end servers and\n",
    "\n",
    "and the backend-workers need to connect to database as well as the redis services etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the right way to establish connectivity between these services or tiers of my application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pods all have an IP address assigned to them as we can see on the screen but these IP as we\n",
    "\n",
    "know are not static.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pods can go down any time and new pods are created all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so you cannot rely on these IP addresses for internal communication between the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also what if the first front-end POD at 10.244.0.3 need to connect to a backend service?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the three would it go to\n",
    "\n",
    "and who makes that decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "A kubernetes service can help us group these PODs together and provide a single interface to access\n",
    "\n",
    "the PODs in a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example a service created for the backend PODs will help group all the backend PODs together and\n",
    "\n",
    "provide a single interface for other PODs to access this service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The requests are forwarded to one of the PODs under the service randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly create additional services for Redis and allow the backend parts to access the redis systems\n",
    "\n",
    "through the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables us to easily and effectively deploy a microservices based application on kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer can now scale or move as required without impacting communication between the various services.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we begin, familiarize with the two options that can come in handy while working with the below commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "--dry-run: By default as soon as the command is run, the resource will be created. If you simply want to test your command , use the --dry-run option. This will not create the resource, instead, tell you weather the resource can be created and if your command is right.\n",
