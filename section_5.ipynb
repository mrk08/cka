    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will talk about updates and rollbacks in a deployment before we look at how we upgrade our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's trying to understand rollouts and versioning in a deployment when you first create a deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "it triggers a rollout a new rollout creates a new deployment revision let's call it revision 1 in the\n",
    "\n",
    "future when the application is upgraded meaning when the container version is updated to a new one a\n",
    "\n",
    "new rollout is triggered and a new deployment revision is created named revision 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps us keep track of the changes made to our deployment and enables us to roll back to a previous\n",
    "\n",
    "version of deployment if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the status of your rollout by running the command: kubectl rollout status followed by\n",
    "\n",
    "the name of the deployment to see the revisions and history of rollout.\n",
    "\n",
    "run the command kubectl rollout history followed by the deployment name\n",
    "\n",
    "And this will show you the revisions and history of our deployment there are two types of deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example you have five replicas of your web application instance deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to upgrade these to a newer version is to destroy all of these and then create newer versions\n",
    "\n",
    "of application instances meaning first destroy the five running instances and then deploy five new instances\n",
    "\n",
    "of the new application version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this as you can imagine is that during the period after the older versions are down\n",
    "\n",
    "and before any newer version is up the application is down and inaccessible to users this strategy is\n",
    "\n",
    "known as the Recreate strategy,\n",
    "\n",
    "And thankfully this is not the default deployment strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy is where we did not destroy all of them at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we take down the older version and bring up a newer version one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way the application never goes down and the upgrade is seamless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember if you do not specify a strategy while creating the deployment it will assume it to be rolling\n",
    "\n",
    "update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words rolling update is the default deployment strategy so we talked about upgrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "How exactly do you update your deployment when you say update.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be different things such as updating your application version by updating the version of docker\n",
    "\n",
    "containers used, updating their labels or updating the number of replicas etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have a deployment definition file it is easy for us to modify this file once we make\n",
    "\n",
    "the necessary changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "we run the kubectl apply command to apply the changes. A new rollout is triggered and a new revision\n",
    "\n",
    "after deployment is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is another way to do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could use the kubectl set image command to update the image of your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember doing it this way will result in the deployment definition file having a different configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "so you must be careful when using the same definition file to make changes in the future the difference\n",
    "\n",
    "between the recreate and rolling update strategies can also be seen when you view the deployments in\n",
    "\n",
    "detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the kubectl describe deployment command to see detailed information regarding the deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will notice when the recreate strategy was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The events indicate that the old replica set was scaled down to zero first and then the new replica\n",
    "\n",
    "sets scaled up to five.\n",
    "\n",
    "However when the Rolling update strategy was used the old replicas set was scaled down one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "simultaneously scaling up the new replica set one at a time let's look at how a deployment performs\n",
    "\n",
    "an upgrade under the hood when a new deployment is created say to deploy five replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "it first creates a Replicaset automatically, which in turn creates the number of PODs required to meet\n",
    "\n",
    "the number of replicas.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you upgrade your application as we saw in the previous slide, the kubernetes deployment object\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a new replica set under the hood and starts deploying the containers there at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "taking down the parts in the old replica set following a rolling update strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be seen when you try to list the replicasets using the kubectl get replicasets command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see the old replicaset with 0 PODs and the new replicaset with 5 PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for instance once you upgrade your application you realize something is inferior right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something's wrong with the new version of build.\n",
    "\n",
    "You used to upgrade so you would like to roll back your update kubernetes deployments allow you to\n",
    "\n",
    "roll back to a previous revision to undo a change.\n",
    "\n",
    "run the command kubectl rollout undo followed by the name of the deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment will then destroy the PODs in the new replicaset and bring the older ones up in the\n",
    "\n",
    "old replicaset. And your application is back to its older format.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you compare the output of the kubectl get replicasets command, before and after the rollback,\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to notice this difference before the rollback.\n",
    "\n",
    "the first replicaset had 0 PODs and the new replicaset had 5 PODs\n",
    "\n",
    "and this is reversed after the rollback is finished. And finally let’s get back to one of the commands\n",
    "\n",
    "we ran initially when we learned about PODs for the first time. We used the kubectl run command\n",
    "\n",
    "to create a pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command in fact creates a deployment and not just a pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the output of the command says Deployment nginx created.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is another way of creating a deployment by only specifying the image name and not using a definition\n",
    "\n",
    "file the required replica set and parts are automatically created in the back end using a definition\n",
    "\n",
    "file is recommended though as you can save the file check it into the code repository and modify it\n",
    "\n",
    "later as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the commands real quick, use the kubectl create command to create the deployment, get\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment command to list the deployments apply and set image commands to update the deployments and\n",
    "\n",
    "rollout status command to see the status of rollouts and rollout undo command to roll back a deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operation.\n",
    "\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad Mannambath.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will talk about Command and Arguments in a Pod Definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not listed as a required topic in the certification curriculum but I think it's important to\n",
    "\n",
    "explain as it is a topic that is usually overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first refresh our memory on commands in containers and docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then translate this into pods in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will look at commands arguments and entry points in Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you were to run a docker container from an Ubuntu image.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the “docker run ubuntu” command, it runs an instance of Ubuntu image and exits immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you were to list the running containers you wouldn't see the container running.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you list all containers including those that are stopped you will see that the new container you\n",
    "\n",
    "ran is in an exited state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now why is that unlike virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are not meant to host an operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers are meant to run a specific task or process such as to host an instance of a web server or\n",
    "\n",
    "application server or a database or simply to carry out some kind of computation or analysis once the\n",
    "\n",
    "task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The container exits a container only lives as long as the process inside it is alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the web service inside the container is stopped or crashes the container exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "So who defines what process is run within the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the docker file for popular Docker images like NGINX you will see an instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "called CMD which stands for command that defines the program that will be run within the container when\n",
    "\n",
    "it starts. For the NGINX image\n",
    "\n",
    "it is the nginx command, for the mysql image\n",
    "\n",
    "it is the mysqld command.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we tried to do earlier was to run a container with a plain Ubuntu Operating System\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at the docker file for this image you will see that it uses bash as the default command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now bash is not really a process like a web server or database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a shell that listens for inputs from a terminal if it cannot find a terminal it exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we ran the Ubuntu container earlier Docker created a container from the Ubuntu image and launched\n",
    "\n",
    "the bash program by default Docker does not attach a terminal to a container when it is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so the bash program does not find the terminal and so it exits since the process that was started\n",
    "\n",
    "when the container was created finished the container exits as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you specify a different command to start the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to append a command to the docker run command and that way it overrides the default command\n",
    "\n",
    "specified within the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case I run the docker run ubuntu command with the “sleep 5” command as the added option.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way when the container starts it runs the sleep program, waits for 5 seconds and then exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do you make that change permanent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you want the image to always run the sleep command when it starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would then create your own image from the base Ubuntu image and specify a new command.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different ways of specifying the command either the command simply as is in a shell form or\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in a JSON array format like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember, when you specify in a JSON array format, the first element in the array should be the executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the sleep program do not specify the command and parameters together like this the command\n",
    "\n",
    "and its parameters should be separate elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I now build by new image using the docker build command, and name it as ubuntu-sleeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "I could now simply run the docker Ubuntu sleeper command and get the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It always sleeps for five seconds and exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if I wish to change the number of seconds it sleeps currently.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is hard coded to five seconds as we learned before.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to run the docker run command with the new command appended to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case sleep 10 and so the command that will be run at startup will be sleep 10 but it doesn't\n",
    "\n",
    "look very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the image Ubuntu sleeper in itself implies that the container will sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we shouldn't have to specify the sleep command again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we would like it to be something like this Docker run Ubuntu sleeper 10 we only want to pass\n",
    "\n",
    "in the number of seconds the containers should sleep and sleep command should be invoked automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "and that is where the entry point instruction comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entry point instruction is like the command instruction as in you can specify the program that will\n",
    "\n",
    "be run when the container starts and whatever you specify on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case 10 will get appended to the entry point so the command that will be run when the container\n",
    "\n",
    "starts is sleep 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the difference between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of the CMD instruction the command line parameters passed will get replaced entirely, whereas\n",
    "\n",
    "in case of entry point the command line parameters will get appended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in the second case what if I run the ubuntu-sleeper without appending the number of\n",
    "\n",
    "seconds then the command at startup will be just sleep and you get the error that the operant is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you configure a default value for the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one was not specified in the command line that's where you would use both entry point as well as\n",
    "\n",
    "the command instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the command instruction will be appended to the entry point instruction so at startup the\n",
    "\n",
    "command would be sleep 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you didn't specify any parameters in the command line if you did then that will override the command\n",
    "\n",
    "instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember for this to happen you should always specify the entry point and command instructions in\n",
    "\n",
    "a JSON format. Finally,\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you really really want to modify the entry point during runtime say from sleep to an imaginary\n",
    "\n",
    "sleep 2.0 command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well in that case you can override it by using the entry point option in the docker run command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final command at startup would then be sleep 2.0 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture and I will see you in the next.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now look at Command and Arguments in a Kubernetes POD. In the previous lecture we created a simple\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker image that sleeps for a given number of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "We named it ubuntu-sleeper and we ran it using the docker command docker run ubuntu-sleeper. By default\n",
    "\n",
    "It sleeps for five seconds but you can override it by passing a command line argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now create a pod using this image.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a blank pod definition template,\n",
    "\n",
    "input the name of the pod and specify the image name.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the pod is created, it creates a container from the specified image, and the container sleeps for\n",
    "\n",
    "five seconds before exiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you need the container to sleep for 10 seconds as in the second command how do you specify the\n",
    "\n",
    "additional argument in the pod definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anything that is appended to the docker run command will go into the “args” property of the pod definition\n",
    "\n",
    "file in the form of an array like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to relate that to the docker file we created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dockerfile has an Entrypoint as well as a CMD instruction specified. The entrypoint is the\n",
    "\n",
    "command that is run at startup, and the CMD is the default parameter passed to the command. With the args\n",
    "\n",
    "option in the pod definition file\n",
    "\n",
    "we override the CMD instruction in the Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you need to override the entrypoint? Say from sleep to a hypothetical sleep2.0 command? In\n",
    "\n",
    "the docker world.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would run the docker run command with the entry point option set to the new command the corresponding\n",
    "\n",
    "entry in the pod definition file would be using a command field the command field corresponds to entry\n",
    "\n",
    "point instruction in the docker file so to summarize there are two fields that correspond to two instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "in the docker file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command field overrides the entry point instruction and the args field overrides the command instruction\n",
    "\n",
    "in the docker file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember it is not the command field that overrides the CMD instruction in the docker file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it about commands and arguments in Kubernetes head over to the coding exercises section\n",

    "\n",
    "definition file which uses the same image as the dockor command.\n",
    "\n",
    "We ran in the last lecture to set an environment variable, use the ENV property. ENV is an array. So every\n",

    "item under the env property starts with a dash, indicating an item in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item has a name and a value property.\n",

    "format.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are other ways of setting the environment variables such as using config maps and secrets.\n",

    "If you wish to add additional key value pairs simply specify the from literal options multiple times.\n",

    "The apiVersion is v1, kind is ConfigMap. Under metadata specify the name of the config\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on secrets in Kubernetes. Here we have a simple python web application\n",
    "\n",
    "that connects to a mysql database. On success\n",
    "\n",
    "the application displays a successful message.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look closely into the code you will see the hostname username and password hardcoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is of course not a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned in the previous lecture, one option would be to move these values into a configMap. The\n",
    "\n",
    "configMap stores configuration data in plain text format.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while it would be okay to move the hostname and username into a configMap it is definitely not\n",
    "\n",
    "the right place to store a password.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where secrets coming secrets are used to store sensitive information like passwords or keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're similar to configMap except that they're stored in an encoded or hashed format as with config\n",
    "\n",
    "maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two steps involved in working with secrets.\n",
    "\n",
    "First create the secret and second injected into pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of creating a secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The imperative way - without using a Secret definition file and the Declarative way by using a Secret\n",
    "\n",
    "definition file with the imperative method.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can directly specify the key value pairs in the command line itself to create a secret of the given\n",
    "\n",
    "values, run the kubectl create secret generic command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command is followed by the secret name and the option –from-literal. The from literal option is used to\n",
    "\n",
    "specify the key value pairs in the command itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are creating a secret by the name app-secret, with a key value pair\n",
    "\n",
    "DB_Host=mysql. If you wish to add additional key value pairs, simply specify the from literal\n",
    "\n",
    "options multiple times however this could get complicated when you have too many secrets to pass in\n",
    "\n",
    "another way to input the secret data is through a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the –from-file option to specify a path to the file that contains the required data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data from this file is read and stored under the name of the file let us now look at the declarative\n",
    "\n",
    "approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we create a definition file, just like how we did for the ConfigMap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file has apiVersion, kind, metadata and data. The apiVersion is v1, kind is Secret. Under metadata specify\n",
    "\n",
    "the name of the secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call it app-secret. Under data add the secret data in a key-value format.\n",
    "\n",
    "However one thing we discussed about secrets was that there used to store sensitive data and are stored\n",
    "\n",
    "in an encoded format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have specified the data in plain text which is not very safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "So while creating a secret with a declarative approach you must specify the secret values in a hashed\n",
    "\n",
    "format.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you must specify the data in an encoded form like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do you convert the data from plain text to an encoded format on a linux host from the command.\n",
    "\n",
    "echo –n followed by the text you are trying to convert, which is mysql in this case and pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "that to the base64 utility. To view secrets run the kubectl get secrets command. This lists\n",
    "\n",
    "the newly created secret along with another secret previously created by kubernetes for its internal\n",
    "\n",
    "purposes to view more information on the newly created secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "run the kubectl describe secret command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the attributes in the secret but hides the value themselves to view the values as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "run the kubectl get secret command with the output displayed in a YAML format using the\n",
    "\n",
    "–o option.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now see the hashed values as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how do you decode these hashed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the same base64 Command used earlier to encode it but this time add a decode option to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have secret created let us proceed with step 2 configuring it with a pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have a simple pod definition file that runs my application.\n",
    "\n",
    "To inject an environment variable, add a new property to the container called envFrom. The envFrom\n",
    "\n",
    "property is a list so we can pass as many environment variables as required each item in the list corresponds\n",
    "\n",
    "to a secret item.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify the name of the secret we created earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the pod definition file now makes the data in the secret available as environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "for the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we just saw was injecting secrets as environment variables into the PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other ways to inject secret into PODs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inject as single environment variables or inject the whole secret as files in a volume if you\n",
    "\n",
    "were to mount the secret as a volume in the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each attribute in the secret is created as a file with the value of the secret as its content.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case since we have three attributes in our secret three files are created and if we look at\n",
    "\n",
    "the contents of the D.B. password file we see the password in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it for this lecture.\n",

    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14827414#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that secrets encode data in base64 format. Anyone with the base64 encoded secret can easily decode it. As such the secrets can be considered as not very safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of safety of the Secrets is a bit confusing in Kubernetes. The kubernetes documentation page and a lot of blogs out there refer to secrets as a \"safer option\" to store sensitive data. They are safer than storing in plain text as they reduce the risk of accidentally exposing passwords and other sensitive data. In my opinion it's not the secret itself that is safe, it is the practices around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secrets are not encrypted, so it is not safer in that sense. However, some best practices around using secrets make it safer. As in best practices like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Not checking-in secret object definition files to source code repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling Encryption at Rest for Secrets so they are stored encrypted in ETCD. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the way kubernetes handles secrets. Such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A secret is only sent to a node if a pod on that node requires it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubelet stores the secret into a tmpfs so that the secret is not written to disk storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Pod that depends on the secret is deleted, kubelet will delete its local copy of the secret data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read about the protections and risks of using secrets here\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having said that, there are other better ways of handling sensitive data like passwords in Kubernetes, such as using tools like Helm Secrets, HashiCorp Vault. I hope to make a lecture on these in the future.\n",

    "You don't want to march and bloat the code of the two services as each of them target different functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "and you'd still like them to be developed and deployed separately you only need the two functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "to work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need one agent per web server instance paired together that can scale up and down together and that\n",
    "\n",
    "is why you have multi-container pods that share the same lifecycle which means they are created together\n",
    "\n",
    "and destroyed together they share the same network space which means they can refer to each other as\n",

    "In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD's lifecycle. For example in the multi-container pod that we talked about earlier that has a web application and logging agent, both the containers are expected to stay alive at all times. The process running in the log agent container is expected to stay alive as long as the web application is running. If any of them fails, the POD restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But at times you may want to run a process that runs to completion in a container. For example a process that pulls a code or binary from a repository that will be used by the main web application. That is a task that will be run only  one time when the pod is first created. Or a process that waits  for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts. That's where initContainers comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An initContainer is configured in a pod like all other containers, except that it is specified inside a initContainers section,  like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "apiVersion: v1\n",
    "kind: Pod\n",
    "metadata:\n",

    "\n",
    "When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, and the process in the initContainer must run to a completion before the real container hosting the application starts. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-pod containers. In that case each init container is run one at a time in sequential order.\n",
