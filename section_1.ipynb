    "Hello and welcome to the Certified Kubernetes Administrators course.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad Mannambeth and I will be your instructor for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "So about me, I am a Solutions Architect specializing on Cloud, Automation and DevOps Technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have authored several Best Seller and Top Rated courses on technologies like Docker,\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes and OpenShift as well as automation technologies like Ansible, Chef and Puppet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is the third installment in the series on Kubernetes and focuses on the Administrator Certification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the structure of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a series of lectures on various topics in Kubernetes, where we simplify complex concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "using illustration and animation and some fun analogies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have optional quizzes that test your knowledge after each lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have hundreds of practice questions that will help you practice what you learned on a real live environment\n",
    "\n",
    "right in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes you don't need to have your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We give you the required labs that are real and that can be accessed by you anywhere, anytime,\n",
    "\n",
    "And as many times as you want. The kubernetes certification is hands-on,\n",
    "\n",
    "So the practice test will give you enough experience and practice on getting ready for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on this coming soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a dedicated slack channel that you get exclusive access to where experts and other students\n",
    "\n",
    "gather to help you clear your doubts and get instant support on your queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also discuss some tips and tricks throughout this course to help you crack the certification\n",
    "\n",
    "exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as always if you have any questions, you may reach out directly to us through our Q&A section or\n",
    "\n",
    "slack channel. Now, this is one of the course in the series on Kubernetes and focuses on getting\n",
    "\n",
    "the Kubernetes Administrators Certification. So having a basic understanding to some of the concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "and pre-requisites will help. Knowing basics of Docker, and some basics of kubernetes itself, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "pods, deployments and service and having a good understanding of the YAML language, setting up a basic\n",
    "\n",
    "lab environment using virtual box can all help in this journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do discuss setting up a kubernetes cluster in detail in this course and we also have online labs\n",
    "\n",
    "and practice tests for a lot of these concepts,\n",
    "\n",
    "but if you are an absolute beginner I highly recommend taking the Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners\n",
    "\n",
    "course first which is a short quick introduction to some of the basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now look at the Course Objectives. The objectives of this course are aligned to match the Certified Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "administrators exam curriculum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss about details around the certification itself in one of the upcoming lectures before\n",
    "\n",
    "heading into any of these topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "However remember this is not just a course to clear the certification.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed a number of other related topics and the intent of this course is to get you to be good\n",
    "\n",
    "at installing configuring and troubleshooting kubernetes cluster. With the way the contents are organized\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we do not start the course by building a cluster from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "We actually do it towards the end of the course in the Installation, Configuration and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working on pre-built live clusters throughout the earlier sections in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "And I think that makes sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this as learning to engineer and build a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be much easier, if you have already driven a car, know how it works. If you know what the wheels are for, what\n",
    "\n",
    "the transmission is for, what the brakes are for and how to fill fuel etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way you would be able to relate those to the underlying concepts better when you learn them and\n",
    "\n",
    "that is why I think practicing on prebuilt clusters and learning the basic concepts first will help\n",
    "\n",
    "you understand how to build a cluster from scratch towards the end of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the core concepts, where we look at the various components that form the Kubernetes architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then discuss some of the API primitives. Here\n",
    "\n",
    "we mostly recap what we learned in the beginners course about PODs, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at services and other network primitives. In the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with Labels & Selectors, followed by daemon sets and how resource limits can affect pod placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at ways of manually scheduling a pod and configuring multiple schedulers and how to view the\n",
    "\n",
    "scheduler events. In the logging and monitoring section\n",
    "\n",
    "we look at different ways of monitoring and logging the cluster of components as well as applications\n",
    "\n",
    "hosted on the cluster. In the Application Lifecycle Management section,\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at rolling updates and rollbacks and various ways of configuring applications, scaling applications\n",
    "\n",
    "and primitives necessary to create a self-healing application. In the cluster maintenance section,\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at the different options available to take down a node in the cluster for maintenance purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at how software releases are organized in Kubernetes, followed by the cluster upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "process.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will perform an upgrade to a live cluster yourself in the practice test without taking down the\n",
    "\n",
    "application.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally we look at the different backup and restore methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then move to security.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by looking at different ways of authenticating into the that as cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a good look at TLS certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start all the way from the absolute basics of TLS certificates into how exactly a cluster can\n",
    "\n",
    "be secured with these.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are many practice exercises around that. You will be asked to troubleshoot and fix issues related\n",
    "\n",
    "to certificates which I believe will give you confidence in working with certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at the new certificates API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at role based access controls and attribute based access controls for authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at network policies and security contacts in the networking section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with some optional networking prerequisite lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "These will help you understand and troubleshoot networking in kubernetes is in-depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start by understanding the basics of networking in Linux, basics of switching and routing and bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "networks in the Linux system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We try and understand the basics of DNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "What core DNS is. We then look at network name spaces and then relate those concepts to networking\n",
    "\n",
    "in Docker. We then start with networking in a kubernetes cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at CNI and what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at one of the CNI networks in depth and how it functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at how service networking works under the hood. We then look at DNS and kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally increase networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course this section is filled with practice exercises where you will practice viewing and gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "network information from a cluster, implementing network configurations and, troubleshooting network\n",
    "\n",
    "related issues in a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look look at designing, installing, configuring and validating a kubernetes cluster from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Kelsey High Towers Kubernetes the hard way as the basis for this, but we deploy the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "on our local machine using virtual box and Vagrant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand how a High Availability cluster works, how an ETCD cluster works and the best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "in deploying an HA cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at two ways of bootstrapping the worker Node one the usual way and the other using the TLS\n",
    "\n",
    "bootstrap approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We finally perform end-to-end tests on the cluster we deployed using the kubernetes testing infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this\n",
    "\n",
    "you should have gained enough knowledge on how the various components work together in a kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So troubleshooting piece should come to you naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look at some techniques that can be followed while troubleshooting a cluster and applications running\n",
    "\n",
    "on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we have a number of practice tests where we give you a broken cluster and you troubleshoot and\n",
    "\n",
    "fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's a lot and we plan to add more relevant topics to this list going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally a word about practice tests the kubernetes certification exam is a practical hands on exam\n",
    "\n",
    "so it is very important to practice what you learn which is why we have got a custom solution that will\n",
    "\n",
    "give you access to a real Kubernete environment right in your browser along with a quiz portal that\n",
    "\n",
    "provides fun and challenging problems for you to solve your required to gain a set of different skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with kubernetes, such as how to look for information how to troubleshoot issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why we have questions whether you will be asked to find information within an environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also be asked to perform configuration tasks where you will be required to configure and deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "applications and services on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test your work and provide feedback instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will occasionally make changes to the environment or break stuff and ask you to troubleshoot and\n",
    "\n",
    "fix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are common issues that one would face while working with kubernetes and these exercises will\n",
    "\n",
    "help you troubleshoot and fix issues quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you see an error message you should be able to understand what that means and where to look for\n",
    "\n",
    "information related to that error message and how to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major challenges in a practical test like the one in the kubernetes certification is time\n",
    "\n",
    "even simple issues like a typo or an indentation error in a YAML file can take a beginner hours to\n",
    "\n",
    "fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we have hundreds of such exercises in this course that will make you an expert and give\n",
    "\n",
    "you enough practice to help you clear the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that’s all for now,\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for enrolling and I'll see you in class.\n",

    "\n",
    "What is it, why you need it and how to prepare for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no doubt about the fact that the adoption of Kubernetes is expected to grow exponentially\n",
    "\n",
    "in the coming years as seen in the graph from Google Trends. As per\n",
    "\n",
    "a recent survey conducted by indeed Kubernetes had the fastest growth in job searches over 173 percent from a year before.\n",
    "\n",
    "a recent survey conducted by indeed Kubernetes had the fastest growth in job searches over 173 percent from a year before.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so it is important for us to be prepared to establish credibility and value in the market. Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "administrator certification developed by cloud native computing Foundation in collaboration with the\n",

    "\n",
    "you on attending the certification.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be certified to design, build and administer highly available Kubernetes clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about the certification at cncf.io/certification/cka\n",
    "\n",
    "As of today, the exam costs 300 U.S. dollars with one free retake in case you do not manage to pass\n",
    "\n",
    "on the initial attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have one more attempt available for free within the next twelve months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode of delivery is online.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deliver the exam anytime anywhere and the comfort of your house since this is an online exam\n",
    "\n",
    "and online Proctor will be watching you at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a set of requirements that need to be met with respect to the environment the room your attending\n",
    "\n",
    "the exam from the system you are using to give the test your Network Connectivity etc. All of these\n",
    "\n",
    "are described in detail in the candidate handbook available on the certification website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most of these certification exams out there the Kubernetes certification is not a multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "choice exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an online performance based exam that tests your hands on skills with the technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would mean that you don't have to worry about memorizing lots of different numbers in preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "for the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "However you need to know how the technology works and how you can get it to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given different tasks to complete in a set amount of time which happens to be three hours\n",
    "\n",
    "for this exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the exam guidelines, you will, however, be able to refer to the Kubernetes official documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "pages at all times during the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in this course we will walk through how to make best use of the documentation site so that you can\n",
    "\n",
    "easily locate the right information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well I wish you good luck in preparing for and delivering the Kubernetes certification exam and I'm sure\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, I want to spend a minute on the Kubernetes Series of courses. Kubernetes is one of\n",
    "\n",
    "the most trending technology in cloud computing as of today.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is supported on any cloud platform and supports hosting enhanced and complex applications on various\n",
    "\n",
    "kinds of architectures that make it a vast and complex technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a set of pre-requisite knowledge required such as containers, applications, YAML files etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of topics to discuss, a lot of concepts to cover such as the Architecture, Networking, Load Balancing,\n",
    "\n",
    "a variety of monitoring tools, Auto Scaling, Configuration, Security, Storage etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are students from different backgrounds, such as the Absolute Beginners to Kubernetes, or those\n",
    "\n",
    "with some experience looking for specialized knowledge in administration or those from an application\n",
    "\n",
    "development background.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two certifications in the mix as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "One for the administrators and another for the application developers covering all of these topics for\n",
    "\n",
    "all of these topics for all of these students in a single course is an impossible task. Which is why we created a 3 course\n",
    "\n",
    "series so each course can target specific audience topics and certifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners course, the Certified Kubernetes Administrator's course and\n",
    "\n",
    "the certified kubernetes application developer’s course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at what we cover in each of these courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubernetes for the Absolute Beginners course helps a beginner having no prior experience with containers\n",
    "\n",
    "or container orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "get started with the concepts of Kubernetes. As\n",
    "\n",
    "this is a beginners course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not deep dive into technical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "instead we focus on a high level overview of Kubernetes, setting up a simple lab environment to play with\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes, learning the pre-requisites required to understand and get started, understanding the various\n",
    "\n",
    "concepts to deploy an application such as pods replica sets deployments and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is also suitable for a non-technical person trying to understand the basic concepts of Kubernetes,\n",
    "\n",
    "just enough to get involved in discussions around the technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kubernetes for Administrators course focuses on advanced topics on Kubernetes and in-depth discussions\n",
    "\n",
    "into the various concepts around deploying a high availability cluster for production use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding more about scheduling, monitoring, maintenance, security, storage and troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course also helps you prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator Exam and get you\n",
    "\n",
    "verified as a Kubernetes Administrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kubernetes for Developers course is for Application Developers who are looking to learn how to\n",
    "\n",
    "design, build and configure cloud native applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you don't have to be an expert application developer for this course and there is no real coding\n",
    "\n",
    "or application development involved in either this course or the certification itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to know the real basics of development on a platform like python or NodeJs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course focuses on topics relevant for a developer such as ConfigMaps, Secrets & ServiceAccounts,\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-container Pods, Readiness & Liveness Probes, Logging & Monitoring, Jobs, Services and\n",
    "\n",
    "networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will also help you prepare for the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these courses are filled with coding exercises and quizzes that will help you practice developing\n",
    "\n",
    "and deploying applications on Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember that there are some topics that overlap between these courses.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "If you're an administrator you may choose to take the beginners as well as the second course and get\n",
    "\n",
    "yourself certified as a Kubernetes Administrator. Or take the beginners course and the developers\n",
    "\n",
    "course to get yourself certified as a Kubernetes Application Developer. Which I’d say is the easier\n",
    "\n",
    "of the two.\n",
