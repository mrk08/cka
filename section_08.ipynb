    "This is Mumshad Mannambeth and we are going through the Certified Kubernetes Administrators Course. In\n",
    "\n",
    "this section\n",
    "\n",
    "we look at the various storage related concepts, such as Persistent Volumes, Persistent Volume Claims,\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modes and how to configure applications with persistent storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many different storage options out there and depending on your environment the options\n",
    "\n",
    "may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "However looking at all of those options is out of scope for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course our focus is on the Kubernetes side of storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get that you should be able to relate that knowledge to implement any third party storage solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's get started.\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we are learning advanced darker concepts in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to talk about doctors Torres drivers and file systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to see where and how doctors stores data and how it manages file systems of containers let\n",
    "\n",
    "us start with how a doctor stores data on the local file system when you install Docker on a system\n",
    "\n",
    "it creates this folder structure at where lip Docker you have multiple folders under it called a few\n",
    "\n",
    "affairs containers image volumes etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where Doctor stores all its data by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I say data I mean files related to images and containers running on the dock or host for example\n",
    "\n",
    "all files related to containers are stored under the containers folder and the files related to images\n",
    "\n",
    "are stored under the image folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any volumes created by the docker containers are created under the volumes folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well don't worry about that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to that in a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now let's just understand where Docker stores its files and in what format.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how exactly does Docker stored the files of an image and a container you understand that we need\n",
    "\n",
    "to understand Dockers layered architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly recap something we learned when Docker builds images it builds these in a layered architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of instruction in the docker file creates a new layer in the Docker image with just the changes\n",
    "\n",
    "from the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the first layer is a base Ubuntu operating system followed by the second instruction that\n",
    "\n",
    "creates a second layer which installs all the APD packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the third instruction creates a third layer which with the python packages followed by the\n",
    "\n",
    "fourth layer that copies the source code over.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then finally the fifth layer that updates the entry point of the image since each layer only stores\n",
    "\n",
    "the changes from the previous layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is reflected in the size as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the base one to image it is around and 120 megabytes in size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AAPT packages that are installed is around 300 M B and then the remaining layers are small to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "the advantages of this layered architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a second application this application has a different darker file but is very similar\n",
    "\n",
    "to our first application as in it uses the same base image as a one to use as the same python and flask\n",
    "\n",
    "dependencies but uses a different source code to create a different application.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so a different entry point as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I run the docker build command to build a new image for this application since the first three\n",
    "\n",
    "layers of both the applications are the same Docker is not going to build the first three layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead it reuses the same three layers it built for the first application from the cache and only creates\n",
    "\n",
    "the last two layers with the new sources and the new entry point this way Docker builds images faster\n",
    "\n",
    "and efficiently saves disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also applicable if you were to update your application code whenever you update your application\n",
    "\n",
    "code such as the abductee y in this case Docker simply reuses all the previous layers from cache and\n",
    "\n",
    "quickly rebuilds the application image by updating the latest source code thus saving us a lot of time\n",
    "\n",
    "during rebuilds and updates let's rearrange the layers bottom up so we can understand it better at the\n",
    "\n",
    "bottom we have the base open to layer then the packages then the dependencies and then the source code\n",
    "\n",
    "of the application and then the entry point all of these layers are created when we run the docker build\n",
    "\n",
    "command to form the final Docker image so all of these are the Docker image layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the build is complete you cannot modify the contents of these layers and so they are read only\n",
    "\n",
    "and you can only modify them by initiating a new build when you run a container based off of this image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the docker run command Docker creates a container based off of these layers and creates a new\n",
    "\n",
    "rateable layer on top of the image layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rateable layer is used to store data created by the container such as log files by the applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any temporary files generated by the container or just any file modified by the user on that container\n",
    "\n",
    "the life of this layer though is only as long as the container is alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the container is destroyed this layer and all of the changes stored in it are also destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the same image layer is shared by all containers created using this image if I were to\n",
    "\n",
    "log into the newly created container and say create a new file called temp dot t t.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would create that file in the container layer which is read and write.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just said that the files in the image layer are read only meaning you cannot edit anything in those\n",
    "\n",
    "layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example of our application code since we bake our code into the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is part of the image layer and as such is read only after running a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if I wish to modify the source code to say test a change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the same image layer may be shared between multiple containers created from this image.\n",
    "\n",
    "So does it mean that I cannot modify this file inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I can still modify this file but before I save the modified file Docker automatically creates a\n",
    "\n",
    "copy of the file in the read write layer and I will then be modifying a different version of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "in the rewrite layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "All future modifications will be done on this copy of the file in the rewrite layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called copy on write mechanism the image layer being read only just means that the files in\n",
    "\n",
    "these layers will not be modified in the image itself so the image will remain the same all the time\n",
    "\n",
    "until you rebuild the image using the docker build command.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when we get rid of the container all of the data that was stored in the container layer\n",
    "\n",
    "also gets deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change we made to the Abdul Pillai and the new ten file we created will also get removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what if we wish to persist this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we were working with a database and we would like to preserve the data created by the\n",
    "\n",
    "container we could add a persistent volume to the container to do this first create a volume using the\n",
    "\n",
    "docker volume create command.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we run the docker volume create data underscore volume command it creates a folder called data\n",
    "\n",
    "underscore volume under the var lib Docker volumes directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then when I run the docker container using the docker run command I could mount this volume inside the\n",
    "\n",
    "docker containers rewrite layer using the dash the option like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I would do a docker run Daschle then specify my newly created volume name followed by a colon and\n",
    "\n",
    "the location inside my container which is the default location where miniscule stored data and that\n",
    "\n",
    "is where lib my askew.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the image name my askew all this will create a new container and mount the data volume we created\n",
    "\n",
    "into var lib.\n",
    "\n",
    "My obscure folder inside the container so all data written by the database is in fact stored on the\n",
    "\n",
    "volume created on the docker host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the container is destroyed the data is still active.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if you didn't run the docker volume create command to create the volume before the docker run\n",
    "\n",
    "command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if I run the docker run command to create a new instance of my rescue container with the\n",
    "\n",
    "volume data underscore volume 2 which I have not created yet Docker will automatically create a volume\n",
    "\n",
    "named data underscore volume 2 and mount it to the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to see all these volumes if you list the contents of the var lib Docker volumes folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called volume mounting as we are mounting in volume created by Docker under the var lib Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "volumes folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we had our data already at another location for example let's say we have some external\n",
    "\n",
    "storage on the docker host at or slash data and we would like to store database data on that volume\n",
    "\n",
    "and not in the default where the docker volumes folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case we would run a container using the command Docker run Daschle.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in this case we will provide the complete part to the folder we would like to mount.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is what slash data for Slash minus Q Well and so it will create a container and mount the folder\n",
    "\n",
    "to the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called bind mounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are two types of mounts a volume mounting and a bind mount volume mount mounts a volume from\n",
    "\n",
    "the volumes directory and bind mount mounts a directory from any location on the docker host.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final point to note before I let you go using the dash V is an old style the new way is to use dash\n",
    "\n",
    "mount option the dash dash mount is the preferred way as it is more verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have to specify each parameter in a key equals value format.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the previous command can be written with the dash mount option as this using the type source\n",
    "\n",
    "and target options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type in this case is bind the source is the location on my host and target is the location on my\n",
    "\n",
    "container\n",
    "\n",
    "so who is responsible for doing all of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining the layered architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a viable layer moving files across layers to enable copy and write etc. It's the storage drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Dockery uses storage drivers to enable layered architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the common storage drivers are a user fast BTR affairs DFS device mapper overlay and overlay\n",
    "\n",
    "to the selection of the storage driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depends on the underlying OS being used for example with Ubuntu.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default story is driver is a new offence whereas this store as driver is not available on other\n",
    "\n",
    "operating systems like fedora or S.O.S.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case device mapper may be a better option Docker will choose the best stories driver available\n",
    "\n",
    "automatically based on the operating system the different stories drivers also provide different performance\n",
    "\n",
    "and stability characteristics so you may want to choose one that fits the needs of your application\n",
    "\n",
    "and your organisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to read more on any of these stories drivers please refer to the links in the attached\n",
    "\n",
    "documentation for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is all from the docker architecture concepts.\n",

    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/17482942#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so in the previous lecture we discussed about storage drivers storage drivers help manage storage\n",
    "\n",
    "on images and containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also briefly touched upon volumes in the previous lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that if you want to persist storage you must create volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that volumes are not handled by storage drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes are handled by volume driver plugins the default volume driver plugin is local the local volume\n",
    "\n",
    "plugin helps create a volume on the Doppler host and store its data under the War label Docker volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other volume driver plugins that allow you to create a volume on third party solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "like as your file storage convoy Digital Ocean block storage locker Google compute persistent desks\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster affairs net app Rex Ray put works and we end we're with for storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few of the many some of these volume drivers support different stories to providers\n",
    "\n",
    "for instance Rex Ray storage fiber can be used to provision storage on a tablet CBS S3 EMC storage arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "like ISIL on and scale Io or Google persistent desk or open stack cinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a docker container you can choose to use a specific volume driver such as the Rex Ray CBS\n",
    "\n",
    "2 provision of volume from Amazon CBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a container and attach a volume from the edible U.S. cloud.\n",

    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/17482962#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now look at container storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface in the past carbonate is used Docker alone as the container runtime engine and all the code\n",
    "\n",
    "to work with Docker was embedded within the net a source code with other container run times coming\n",
    "\n",
    "in such as rocket and cryo.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was important to open up and extend support to work with different container run times and not be\n",
    "\n",
    "dependent on the carbonated source code and that's how container runtime interface came to be the container\n",
    "\n",
    "runtime interface is a standard that defines how an orchestration solution like carbonates would communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "with container run times like Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the future if any new container runtime interface is developed they can simply follow the CRC\n",
    "\n",
    "standards and that new container runtime would work with carbonates without really having to work with\n",
    "\n",
    "the Coburn and his team of developers or touch the Coburn at its source code similarly as we saw in\n",
    "\n",
    "the networking lectures to extend support for different networking solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The container networking interface was introduced now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any new networking renders could simply develop their plug in based on the CNI standards and make their\n",
    "\n",
    "solution work with coordinates and as you can guess the container storage interface was developed to\n",
    "\n",
    "support multiple storage solutions with CSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now write your own drivers for your own storage to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon UBS as your desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dell EMC isolation power Max unity extreme IO NetApp Newton x hp Hitachi Pure Storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone's got their own CSI drivers note that CSI is not a a specific standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is meant to be a universal standard and if implemented allows any container orchestration tool to\n",
    "\n",
    "work with any storage vendor with a supported plug in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently coordinators Cloud Foundry and measles are onboard with CSI.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's what the CSI kind of looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "It defines a set of our pieces or remote procedure calls that will be called by the container orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "and these must be implemented by the storage drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example CSI says that when a pod is created and requires a volume the container orchestrator in\n",
    "\n",
    "this case coordinates should call the create volume RBC and pass a set of details such as the volume\n",
    "\n",
    "name the storage driver should implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "This RBC and handle that request and provision and new volume on the storage array and return the results\n",
    "\n",
    "of the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly container orchestrator should call the delete volume RBC whenever volume is to be deleted\n",
    "\n",
    "and the storage driver should implement the code to decommission the volume from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "When that call is made and the specification details exactly what parameters should be sent by the caller\n",
    "\n",
    "what should be received by the solution and what error codes should be exchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested you can view all these details in the CSI specification on github.\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad Mannambeth. Before we head into persistent volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "let us start with Volumes in Kubernetes. Let us look at volumes in Docker first. Docker containers are\n",
    "\n",
    "meant to be transient in nature which means they are meant to last only for a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are called upon when required to process data and destroyed once finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true for the data within the container the data is destroyed along with the container to\n",
    "\n",
    "persist data processed by the containers we attach a volume to the containers when they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are processed by the container is now placed in this volume thereby retaining it permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the container is deleted the data generated or processed by it remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does that work in the Kubernetes world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in Docker, the PODs created in Kubernetes are transient in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a POD is created to process data and then deleted, the data processed by it gets deleted as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we attach a volume to the POD. The data generated by the POD is now stored in the volume, and\n",
    "\n",
    "even after the POD is delete, the data remains. Let’s look at a simple implementation of volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a single node kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a simple POD that generates a random between 1 and 100 and writes that to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "at /opt/number.out and then gets deleted along with the random number. To retain the\n",
    "\n",
    "number generated by the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a volume and a volume needs a storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a volume you can choose to configure it storage in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the various options in a bit but for now we will simply configure it to use a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case I specify a path /data on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way any files created in the volume would be stored in the directory data on my node. Once the volume\n",
    "\n",
    "is created, to access it from a container we mount the volume to a directory inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the volumeMounts field in each container to mount the data-volume to the directory /opt\n",
    "\n",
    "within the container.\n",
    "\n",

    "the data-volume which is in fact /data directory on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the pod gets deleted, the file with the random number still lives on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a step back and look at the volume storage options.\n",
    "\n",
    "We just used the host path option to configure a directory and the host has storage space for the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that works fine on a single node however it is not recommended for use in a multi node cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the PODs would use the /data directory on all the nodes, and expect all of them\n",
    "\n",
    "to be the same and have the same data since they are on different servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are in fact not the same unless you configure some kind of external replicated cluster storage\n",
    "\n",
    "solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes supports several types of standard storage solutions such as NFS, glusterFS,\n",
    "\n",
    "Flocker, FibreChannel, CephFS, ScaleIO or public cloud solutions like AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "EBS, Azure Disk or File or Google’s Persistent Disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to configure an AWS Elastic Block Store volume as the storage or the volume, we replace\n",
    "\n",
    "hostPath field of the volume with awsElasticBlockStore field along with the volumeID\n",
    "\n",
    "and filesystem type. The Volume storage will now be on AWS EBS.\n",
    "\n",

    "We configured volumes within the pod definition file so every configuration information required to\n",
    "\n",
    "configure storage for the volume goes within the pod definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you have a large environment with a lot of users deploying a lot of pods the users would have\n",

    "to configure storage every time for each pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever storage solution is used the users who deploys the pods would have to configure that on all\n",

    "\n",
    "The user would have to make them on all of his pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead you would like to manage storage more centrally.\n",

    "You would like it to be configured in a way that an administrator can create a large pool of storage\n",

    "and then have users carve out pieces from it has required.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where persistent volumes can help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "A persistent volume is a cluster wide pool of storage volumes configured by an administrator to be used\n",

    "by users deploying applications on the Cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The users can now select storage from this pool using persistent volume claims let us now create a persistent\n",

    "volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the base template and update the API version set the client to persistent volume and\n",
    "\n",
    "name it pv-vol1 under the specs section specify the access modes access mode defines how\n",
    "\n",
    "a volume should be mounted on the hosts whether in a read only mode or read write mode etc. The supported\n",

    "for this persistent volume which is set to 1 GB here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the volume type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with the host path option that uses storage from the nodes local directory.\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes. In the previous lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a persistent volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will create a Persistent Volume Claim to make the storage available to a node. Persistent\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims are two separate objects in the Kubernetes namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Administrator creates a set of Persistent Volumes and a user creates Persistent Volume Claims to\n",
    "\n",
    "use to storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Persistent Volume Claims are created, Kubernetes binds the Persistent Volumes to Claims based\n",
    "\n",
    "on the request and properties set on the volume. Every Persistent Volume Claims is bound to single Persistent\n",
    "\n",
    "volume during the binding process Kubernetes tries to find a persistent volume that has sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "capacity as requested by the claim and any other request properties such as access modes volume modes\n",
    "\n",
    "storage class etc. However if there are multiple possible matches for a single claim and you would like\n",
    "\n",
    "to specifically use a particular volume you could still use labels and selectors to bind to the right\n",
    "\n",
    "volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally note that a smaller claim may get bound to a larger volume if all the other criteria matches\n",
    "\n",
    "and there are no better options.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a one to one relationship between claims and volumes so no other claims can utilize the remaining\n",
    "\n",
    "capacity in the volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no volumes available the persistent volume claim will remain in a pending state until newer\n",
    "\n",
    "volumes are made available to the cluster once newer volumes are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The claim would automatically be bound to the newly available volume let us now create a persistent\n",
    "\n",
    "volume claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a blank template said the API version to V1 and kind to persistent volume claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will name it myclaim. Under specification set the accessModes to ReadWriteOnce. And set resources\n",
    "\n",
    "to request a storage of 500 mega bytes. Create the claim using kubectl create command. To view the\n",
    "\n",
    "created claim run the kubectl get persistentvolumeclaim command. We see the claim in a pending state.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the claim is created, kubernetes looks at the volume created previously. The access Modes match.\n",
    "\n",
    "The capacity requested is 500 Megabytes but the volume is configured with 1 GB of storage. Since there\n",
    "\n",
    "are no other volumes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The persistent volume claim is bound to persistent volume when we run to get volumes command again.\n",

    "\n",
    "delete persistent volume claim command but what happens to the underlying persistent volume when the\n",
    "\n",
    "claim is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose what is to happen to the volume by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is set to retain meaning the persistent volume will remain until it is manually deleted by the administrator.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not available for reuse by any other claims or it can be deleted automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way as soon as the claim is deleted the volume will be deleted as well thus freeing up storage\n",
    "\n",
    "on the end storage device or a third option is to recycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the data in the data volume will be scrubbed before making it available to other claims\n",
