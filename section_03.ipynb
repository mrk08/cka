    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture we look at the different ways of manually scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "a POD on a node. What do you do when you do not have a scheduler in your cluster?\n",
    "\n",
    "You, probably do not want to rely on the built in scheduler and instead want to schedule the PODs yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how exactly does a scheduler work in the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple pod definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every POD has a field called NodeName that, by default, is not set.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t typically specify this field when you create the manifest file, Kubernetes adds it automtically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler goes through all the pods and looks for those that do not have this property set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those are the candidates for scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then identifies the right node for the POD, by running the scheduling algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once identified it schedules the POD on the Node by setting the node Name property to the name of the\n",
    "\n",
    "node by creating a binding object. So if there is no scheduler to monitor and schedule nodes what happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pods continue to be in a pending state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what can you do about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can manually assign pods to node yourself. Well without a scheduler,\n",
    "\n",
    "the easiest way to schedule a pod is to simply set the node name field to the name of the node in your\n",
    "\n",
    "pod specification while creating the POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pod then gets assigned to the specified node. You can only specify the node name at creation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the pod is already created and you want to assign the pod to a node? Kubernetes won’t allow\n",
    "\n",
    "you to modify the node Name property of a pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "So another way to assign a note to an existing pod is to create a binding object and send a post request\n",
    "\n",
    "to the pod binding API thus mimicking what the actual scheduler does. In the binding object you specify\n",
    "\n",
    "a target node with the name of the node. Then send a post request to the pods binding API with the data\n",
    "\n",
    "set to the binding object in a JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you must convert the YAML file into its equivalent JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice test and practice manually scheduling pods on nodes.\n",

    "## 34. Labels and Selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14295582#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture on labels and selectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad Mannambeth what do we know about labels and selectors already labels and selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "are a standard method to group things together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a set of different species.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user wants to be able to filter them based on different criteria such as based on their class or kind\n",
    "\n",
    "if they are domestic or wild or see by their color and not just group.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to be able to filter them based on a criteria such as all green animals or with multiple criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "such as everything green.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is also a bird.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever that classification maybe you need the ability to group things together and filter them based\n",
    "\n",
    "on your needs and the best way to do that is with labels. Labels or properties attached to each item.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you add properties to each item for their class kind and color selectors help you filter these items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example when you say class equals mammal we get a list of mammals and when you say color equals\n",
    "\n",
    "green we get the green mammals we see labels and selectors used everywhere such as the keywords you\n",
    "\n",
    "tag to YouTube videos or blogs that help users filter and find the right content we see labels added\n",
    "\n",
    "to items in an online store that help you add different kinds of filters to view your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how are labels and selectors used in Kubernetes?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a lot of different types of Objects in Kuberentes. Pods, Services, ReplicaSets and Deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "etc. For Kubernetes, all of these are different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time you may end up having hundreds or thousands of these objects in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will need a way to filter and view different objects by different categories such as to group\n",
    "\n",
    "objects by their type or view objects by application or by their functionality whatever it may be.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can group and select objects using labels and selectors for each object attach labels as per your\n",
    "\n",
    "needs, like app, function etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then while selecting specify a condition to filter specific objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example app == App1. So how exactly do you specify labels in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a pod-definition file, under metadata,\n",
    "\n",
    "create a section called labels. Under that add the labels in a key value format like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add as many labels as you like. Once the pod is created, to select the pod with the labels\n",
    "\n",
    "use the kubectl get pods command along with the selector option, and specify the condition like\n",
    "\n",
    "app=App1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is one use case of labels and selectors. Kubernetes objects use labels and selectors internally\n",
    "\n",
    "to connect different objects together. For example to create a replicaset consisting of 3 different\n",
    "\n",
    "pods,\n",
    "\n",
    "we first label the pod definition and use selector in a replicaset to group the pods . In the replica-set\n",
    "\n",
    "set definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see labels defined in two places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is an area where beginners attempt to make a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels defined under the template section are the labels configured on the pods. The labels you see\n",
    "\n",
    "at the top are the labels of the replicas set itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not really concerned about the labels of the replica set for now because we are trying to get\n",
    "\n",
    "the replica set to discover the pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels on the replica set will be used if you were to configure some other object to discover the\n",
    "\n",
    "replica set in order to connect the replica set to the pod we configure the selector field under the\n",
    "\n",
    "replica set specification to match the labels defined on the pod a single label will do if it matches\n",
    "\n",
    "correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if you feel there could be other pods with the same label but with a different function then\n",
    "\n",
    "you could specify both the labels to ensure that the right pods are discovered by the replica set on\n",
    "\n",
    "creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the labels match the replica set is created successfully it works the same for other objects like\n",
    "\n",
    "a service when a service is created it uses the selector defined in the service definition file to match\n",
    "\n",
    "the labels set on the pods in the replica set definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally let’s look at annotations. While labels and selectors are used to group and select objects, annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "are used to record other details for inflammatory purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example tool details like name, version build information etc or contact details, phone numbers, email\n",
    "\n",
    "ids etc, that may be used for some kind of integration purpose. Well, that’s it for this lecture on\n",
    "\n",
    "labels and selectors and annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the coding exercises section and practice working with labels and selectors.\n",
    "\n",

    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/16063306#overview\n",
    "\n",
    ".In this lecture we will discuss about the part to note relationship and how you can restrict what parts\n",
    "\n",
    "are placed on what notes the concept of teens and toleration can be a bit confusing for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will try to understand what they are using an analogy of a bug approaching a person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now my apologies in advance but this is the best I could come up with to prevent the bug from landing\n",
    "\n",
    "on the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "We spray the person with a repellent spray or attained as we will call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture the book is intolerant to the smell.\n",
    "\n",
    "So on approaching the person detained applied on the person throws the bug off however there could be\n",
    "\n",
    "other books that are tolerant to the smell and so the taint doesn't really affect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so they end up landing on the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are two things that decide if a bug can land on a person.\n",
    "\n",
    "First the taint on the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "And second the bugs toleration level to that particular taint getting back to Cuba.\n",
    "\n",
    "NET is the person is a node and the bugs are pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now teens and toleration have nothing to do with security or intrusion on the Cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teens and toleration are used to set restrictions on what parts can be scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a note let us start with a simple cluster with three worker notes the notes are named one two and\n",
    "\n",
    "three.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have a set of paths that are to be deployed on these notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call them A B C and D.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the parts are created common it is scheduler tries to place these parts on the available worker\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now there are no restrictions are limitations and as such the scheduler places the parts across\n",
    "\n",
    "all of the nodes to balance them out equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us assume that we have dedicated resources on Node 1 for a particular use case or application\n",
    "\n",
    "so we would like only those parts that belong to this application to be placed on Node 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we prevent all parts from being placed on the Node by placing a taint on the Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call it blue by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paths have no toleration which means unless specified otherwise none of the parts can tolerate any taint.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case none of the parts can be placed on Node 1 as none of them can tolerate the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blue this solves half of our requirement no unwanted parts are going to be placed on this note.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other half is to enable certain parts to be placed on this note.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we must specify which parts are tolerant to this particular attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case we would like to allow only Part D to be placed on this note so we add a toleration to Part\n",
    "\n",
    "D.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part D is now tolerant to blue so when the scheduler tries to place this part on Node 1 it goes through\n",
    "\n",
    "Node 1 can now only accept parts that can tolerate the taint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blue so with all the teens and toleration is in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the parts would be scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler tries to place part a on not one but due to the team it is thrown off and it goes to note\n",
    "\n",
    "to the scheduler then tries to place part B on not one but again due to the taint it is thrown off and\n",
    "\n",
    "is placed on Node 3 which happens to be the next free node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler then tries to place part c to the Node 1 it is thrown off again and ends up on Node 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the scheduler tries to place part D on Node 1 since the part is tolerant to Node 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "It goes through so remember trains are set on nodes and toleration are set on pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the cube control taint nodes command to taint in node specify the name of the node to train followed\n",
    "\n",
    "by the train itself which is a key value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you would like to dedicate the Node 2 parts in application blue then the key value pair\n",
    "\n",
    "would be ab equals blue the taint effect defines what would happen to the pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they do not tolerate the taint there are three taint effects no schedule which means the parts will\n",
    "\n",
    "not be scheduled on the node which is what we have been discussing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefer No schedule which means the system will try to avoid placing a part on the node but that is not\n",
    "\n",
    "guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "And third is no execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means that new parts will not be scheduled on the node and existing parts on the node if any will\n",
    "\n",
    "be evicted if they do not tolerate the taint.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parts may have been scheduled on Node before the 10th was applied to the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example command would be detained Node node one with the key value pair app equals blue and an effect\n",
    "\n",
    "of no schedule toleration is are added to parts to add a toleration to a pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "First pull up the pod definition file in the spec section of the pod definition file had a section called\n",
    "\n",
    "toleration move the same values used to while creating the taint under this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is app operator is equal value is blue and the effect is no should you.\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember all of these values need to be encoded in double codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the pods are now created or updated with the new toleration they are either not scheduled on nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "or evicted from the existing nodes depending on the effect set let us try to understand the No.\n",
    "\n",
    "Execute takes effect in a bit more depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we have three nodes running some workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not have any teens or toleration at this point so they are scheduled this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then decided to dedicate Node 1 for a special application and as such we obtained the node with the\n",
    "\n",
    "application name and add a toleration to the part that belongs to the application which happens to be\n",
    "\n",
    "part D.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case while tending the node we set the taint effect to no execute and as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once detained on the Node takes effect it evokes Part C from the node which simply means that the part\n",
    "\n",
    "is killed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Part D continues to run on the node as it has a toleration to the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now going back to our original scenario where we have teens and toleration is configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember teens and toleration are only meant to restrict nodes from accepting certain parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case no one can only accept Part D but it does not guarantee that Part D will always be placed\n",
    "\n",
    "on Node 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are no teens or restrictions applied on the other two nodes Part D may very well be placed\n",
    "\n",
    "on any of the other two nodes so remember teens and toleration does not tell the part to go to a particular\n",
    "\n",
    "node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead it tells the node to only accept parts with certain toleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your requirement is to restrict a part to certain nodes it is achieved through another concept called\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask node affinity which we will discuss in the next lecture finally.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we're on this topic let us also take a look at an interesting fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only been referring to the worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we also have master nodes in the cluster which is technically just another note that has all the\n",
    "\n",
    "capabilities of hosting a part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus it runs all the management software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I'm not sure if you noticed the scheduler does not schedule any part on the master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is that when the covenant is cluster is first setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "It teams is set on the master node automatically that prevents any parts from being schedule on this\n",
    "\n",
    "note.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see this as well as modified his behavior if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "However a best practice is to not deploy application workloads on a master server to see this taint\n",
    "\n",
    "run a cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "Control described node command with Cube master as the node name and look for the tail section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see a taint set to not schedule any parts on the master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the coding exercises section and practice working with teens and toleration is.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will talk about nodes selectors in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a three node cluster of which two are smaller nodes with lower hardware resources and one of\n",
    "\n",
    "them is a larger node configured with higher resources you have different kinds of workloads running\n",
    "\n",
    "in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would like to dedicate the data processing workloads that require higher horsepower to the larger\n",
    "\n",
    "node as that is the only node that will not run out of resources in case the job demands extra resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the current default setup, any pods can go to any nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Pod C in this case may very well end up on nodes two or three which is not desired. To solve this\n",
    "\n",
    "we can set a limitation on the pods so that they only run on particular nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is using Node selectors which is the simple and easier method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we look at the pod definition file we created earlier this file has a simple definition to create\n",
    "\n",
    "a pod with a data processing image to limit this pod to run on the larger node\n",
    "\n",
    "We add a new property called Node selector to the spec section and specify the size as large.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait a minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where did the size large come from and how does Kubernetes know which is the large node. The key value\n",
    "\n",
    "pair of size and large are in fact labels assigned to the nodes the scheduler uses these labels to match\n",
    "\n",
    "and identify the right note to place the pods on labels and selectors are a topic we have seen many\n",
    "\n",
    "times throughout this Kubernetes course such as with services replica sets and deployments to use\n",
    "\n",
    "labels in a known selector like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have first labelled your nodes prior to creating this pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let us go back and see how we can label the nodes to label a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the command Kube control label nodes followed by the name of the node and the label in a key value\n",
    "\n",
    "pair format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it would be Kube control label nodes Node 1 followed by the label in a key value format\n",
    "\n",
    "such as size equals large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have labeled the node we can get back to creating the pod this time with the node selector\n",
    "\n",
    "set to a size of large.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the pod is now created it is placed on Node 1 as desired not selectors served our purpose but it\n",
    "\n",
    "has limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a single label and selector to achieve our goal here.\n",
    "\n",

    "For example, we would like to say something like place the pod on a large or medium node or something\n",

    "like place the pod on any nodes that are not small.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about known affinity feature in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of node affinity feature is to ensure that pods are hosted on particular notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case to ensure the large data processing pod ends up on no one in the previous lecture we did\n",
    "\n",
    "this easily using notes selectors we discussed that you cannot provide advanced expressions like or\n",
    "\n",
    "or not with node selectors the node affinity feature provides us with advanced capabilities to limit\n",
    "\n",
    "pod placement on specific nodes with great power comes great complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the simple node selector specification will now look like this with node affinity although both does\n",
    "\n",
    "exactly the same thing plays the pod on the large node let us look at it a bit closer under spec you\n",
    "\n",
    "have affinity and then node affinity under that and then you have a property that looks like a sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "called required during scheduling ignored during execution no description needed for that and then you\n",
    "\n",
    "have the node selector terms that is an array and that is where you will specify the key and value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "the key value pairs are in the form key operator and value where the operator is in the operator ensures\n",
    "\n",
    "that the pod will be placed on a node whose label size has any value in the list of values specified\n",
    "\n",
    "here in this case it is just one called large.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think your part could be placed on a large or a medium node you could simply add the value to\n",
    "\n",
    "the list of values like this you could use the not in operator to say something like size not in small\n",
    "\n",
    "where node affinity will match the node with a size not set to small.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that we have only set the labels size too large and medium nodes the smaller nodes don't even\n",
    "\n",
    "have the labels set.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we don't really have to even check the value of the label as long as we are sure we don't set a label\n",
    "\n",
    "size to the smaller nodes using the exists operator will give us the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exists the operator will simply check if the label size exists on the notes and you don't need the\n",
    "\n",
    "values section for that as it does not compare the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of other operators as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the documentation for specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we understand all of this and we're comfortable with creating a pod with specific affinity rules\n",
    "\n",
    "when the pods are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules are considered and the pods are placed onto the right nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if node affinity could not match a node with a given expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case what if there are no nodes with a label called size say we had the labels and the pods\n",
    "\n",
    "are scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if someone changes the label on the node at a future point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will the pod continue to stay on the Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is answered by the long sentence like property under node affinity which happens to be the\n",
    "\n",
    "type of node affinity the type of node affinity defines the behaviour of the scheduler with respect to\n",
    "\n",
    "node affinity and the stages in the lifecycle of the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two types of node affinity available required during scheduling ignored during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "and preferred during scheduling ignored during execution and there are additional types of node affinity\n",
    "\n",
    "planed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this recording required during scheduling required during execution we will now break this down\n",
    "\n",
    "to understand further.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by looking at the two available affinity types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two states in the lifecycle of a pod when considering node affinity during scheduling and\n",
    "\n",
    "during execution during scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the state where a pod does not exist and is created for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have no doubt that when a pod is first created the affinity rules specified are considered to place\n",
    "\n",
    "the pods on the right note.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if the nodes with matching labels are not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example we forgot to label the node as large.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is where the type of node affinity used comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you select the required type which is the first one the scheduler will mandate that the pod be placed\n",
    "\n",
    "on a node with a given affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules if it cannot find one the pod will not be scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type will be used in cases where the placement of the pod is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a matching node does not exist the pod will not be scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's say the pod placement is less important than running the workload itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case you could set it to preferred and in cases where a matching node is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheduler will simply ignore node affinity rules and place the card on any available note.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a way of telling the scheduler hey try your best to place the pod on matching node but if you\n",
    "\n",
    "really cannot find one just plays it anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the property or the other state is during execution during execution is the state\n",
    "\n",
    "where a part has been running and a change is made in the environment that affects node affinity such\n",
    "\n",
    "as a change in the label of a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example say an administrator removed the label we said earlier called size equals large from the\n",
    "\n",
    "node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what would happen to the pods that are running on the Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the two types of node affinity available today has this value set too ignored which means\n",
    "\n",
    "pods will continue to run and any changes in node affinity will not impact them once they are scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new types expected in the future only have a difference in the during execution phase a new option\n",
    "\n",
    "called required during execution is introduced which will evict any pods that are running on notes\n",
    "\n",
    "that do not meet affinity rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the earlier example, a pod running on the large node will be evicted or terminated if the label large\n",
    "\n",
    "is removed from the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the coding exercises and practice working with node affinity rules in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compare tables and toleration and node affinity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have learned about teens and toleration and note affinity let us tie together the two concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "through a fun exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three notes and three parts each in three colors blue red and green.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate aim is to place the blue pod in the Blue Note the red part in the red note and likewise\n",
    "\n",
    "for green.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are sharing the same covenant as cluster with other teams so there are other parts in the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "as well as other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not want any other pod to be placed on our note.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither do we want our pods to be placed on their nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first try to solve this problem using teens and toleration as we apply a taint to the nodes marking\n",
    "\n",
    "them with their colors blue red and green.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we then set a toleration on the part to tolerate the respective colors when the parts are now created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes ensure they only accept the part with the right toleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the green part ends up on the green node and the blue part ends up on the Blue Note.\n",
    "\n",
    "However tense and toleration does not guarantee that the parts will only prefer these notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the red note ends up on one of the other nodes that do not have a taint or toleration set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not desired let us try to solve the same problem with node affinity with node affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first labeled the nodes with their respective colors blue red and green.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then said node selectors on the part to tie the part to the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such the parts end up on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note however that does not guarantee that other parts are not placed on these notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case there is a chance that one of the other parts may end up on our nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not something we desired as such a combination of teens and toleration and no definitive rules\n",
    "\n",
    "can be used together to completely dedicate nodes for specific part we first use taints and toleration\n",
    "\n",
    "to prevent other parts from being placed on our nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we use node affinity to prevent our parts from being placed on their nodes.\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "My name is Mumshad\n",
    "\n",
    "Mannambath. Let us look at a 3 Node Kubernetes cluster. Each node has a set of CPU, Memory and Disk\n",
    "\n",
    "resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every POD consumes a set of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case 2 CPUs , one Memory and some disk space. Whenever a POD is placed on a Node, it consumes resources\n",
    "\n",
    "available to that node. As we have discussed before, it is the kubernetes scheduler that decides which\n",
    "\n",
    "Node a POD goes to. The scheduler takes into consideration, the amount of resources required by a POD\n",
    "\n",
    "and those available on the Nodes. In this case, the scheduler schedules a new POD on Node 2. If the node\n",
    "\n",
    "has no sufficient resources, the scheduler avoids placing the POD on that node Instead places the POD\n",
    "\n",
    "on one where sufficient resources are available if there is no sufficient resources available on any\n",
    "\n",
    "of the nodes, Kubernetes holds back scheduling the POD, and you will see the POD in a pending state.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the events, you will see the reason – insufficient cpu. Let us now focus on the resource\n",
    "\n",
    "resource requirements for each POD. What are these blocks and what are their values?\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, kubernetes assumes that a POD or a container within a POD requires .5 CPU &\n",
    "\n",
    "256 Mebibyte of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the resource request for a container the minimum amount of CPU or memory requested\n",
    "\n",
    "by the container when the scheduler tries to place the pod on a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses these numbers to identify a node which has sufficient amount of resources available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you know that your application will need more than these you can modify these values by specifying\n",
    "\n",
    "them in your pod or deployment definition files in the simple pod definition file.\n",
    "\n",
    "add a section called resources, under which add requests and specify the new values for memory and cpu usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case I set it to 1GB of memory and 1 count of vCPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does 1 count of CPU really mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember these blocks are used for illustration purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't have to be in the increment of point five.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify any value as low as 0.1. 0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU can also be expressed as 100m were m stands for milli.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can go as low as 1m, but not lower than that. 1 count of CPU is equivalent to 1 vCPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s 1 vCPU in AWS, or 1 Core in GCP or Azure or 1 Hyperthread. You could request a higher number\n",
    "\n",
    "of CPUs for the container, provided your Nodes are sufficiently funded. Similarly, with memory you could\n",
    "\n",
    "specify 256 Mebibyte using the Mi suffix. Or specify the same value in Memory like this. Or use the\n",
    "\n",
    "suffix G for a gigabyte.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the difference between G and Gi. G is Gigabyte and it refers to a 1000 Megabytes, whereas Gi\n",
    "\n",
    "Gi refers to Gibibyte and refers to 1024 Mebibyte.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies to megabyte and kilobytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now look at a container running on a node in the docker world a docker container has no limit\n",
    "\n",
    "to the resources it can consume on a Node. Say a container starts with 1 vCPU on a Node, it can go up\n",
    "\n",
    "and consume as much resource as it requires, suffocating the native processes on the node or other containers\n",
    "\n",
    "of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "However you can set a limit for the resource usage on these pods by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes sets a limit of 1vCPU to containers. So if you do not specify explicitly, a container will be limited\n",
    "\n",
    "to consume only 1 vCPU from the Node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same goes with memory. By default, kubernetes sets a limit of 512 Mebibyte on containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "if you don't like the default limit you can change them by adding a limit section under the resources\n",
    "\n",
    "section in your pod definition file. Specify new limits for memory and cpu you like this when the\n",
    "\n",
    "pod is created, kubernetes sets new limits for the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the limits and requests are set for each container within the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens when a pod tries to exceed resources beyond its specified limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of the CPU, kubernetes throttles the CPU so that it does not go beyond the specified limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A container cannot use more CPU resources than its limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not the case with memory. A container CAN use more memory resources that its limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if a pod tries to consume more memory than its limit constantly, the POD will be terminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture on resource requirements in kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the coding exercises section and practice viewing configuring and troubleshooting\n",

    "1. Run the kubectl edit pod <pod name> command.  This will open the pod specification in an editor (vi editor). Then edit the required properties. When you try to save it, you will be denied. This is because you are attempting to edit a field on the pod that is not editable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we look at daemon Sets in Kubernetes. So far we have deployed various pods on different nodes in our\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster. With the help of replica sets and deployments we made sure multiple copies of our applications\n",
    "\n",
    "applications are made available across various different worker nodes. Daemon set are like replica sets, as in it helps\n",
    "\n",
    "you deploy multiple instances of pod. But it runs one copy of your pod on each node in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a new node is added to the cluster a replica of the pod is automatically added to that node\n",
    "\n",
    "and when a node is removed the pod is automatically removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demon set ensures that one copy of the pod is always present in all nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are some use cases of daemonsets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you would like to deploy a monitoring agent or log collector on each of your nodes in the cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "so you can monitor your cluster better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demon set is perfect for that as it can deploy your monitoring agent in the form of a pod\n",
    "\n",
    "in all the nodes in your cluster. Then, you don’t have to worry about adding/removing monitoring agents\n",
    "\n",
    "from these nodes when there are changes in your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "as the daemon set will take care of that for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "While discussing the kubernetes architecture we learned that one of the worker node components that\n",
    "\n",
    "is required on every node in the cluster is a kube-proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is one good use case of daemon Sets. The kubeproxy component can be deployed as a daemon set in the\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use case is for networking. Networking solutions like weave net requires an agent to be deployed\n",
    "\n",
    "on each node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss about networking concepts in much more detail later during this course but I just wanted\n",

    "Creating a DaemonSet is similar to the ReplicaSet creation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has nested pod specification under the template section and selectors to link the daemon set to the\n",
    "\n",
    "PODs. A daemonSet definition file has a similar structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with apiVersion, kind,\n",
    "\n",
    "metadata and spec. The api version is apps/v1. Kind is DaemonSet instead of ReplicaSet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set the name to monitoring daemon. Under spec you have a selector and a pod specification\n",
    "\n",
    "template.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's almost exactly like ReplicaSet definition except that the kind is a demon set. Ensure the labels\n",
    "\n",
    "in the selector matches the ones in the pod template. Once ready create the daemonset using the kubectl\n",
    "\n",
    "create daemonset command. To view the created daemonset run the kubectl get daemonset\n",
    "\n",
    "command.\n",
    "\n",
    "And of course to view more details run the kubectl\n",
    "\n",
    "describe demonSet command.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does a demon set work.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it schedule pods on each node? and How does it ensure that every node has a pod? if you were\n",
    "\n",
    "asked to schedule a pod on each node in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "how would you do it? In one of the previous lectures in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "we discussed that we could set the nodeName property on the pod to bypass the scheduler and get the\n",
    "\n",
    "pod placed on a node directly. So that’s one approach. On each pod, set the nodeName property in its\n",
    "\n",
    "specification before it is created and when they are created, they automatically land on the respective\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes. So that’s how it used to be until kubernetes version v1.12. From v1.12 onwards\n",
    "\n",
    "the Daemon set uses the default scheduler and node affinity rules that we learned in one of the previous\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture we discuss about static pods in Kubernetes. Earlier,\n",
    "\n",
    "in this course we talked about the Architecture and how the kubelet functions as one of the many control\n",
    "\n",
    "plane components in Kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubelet relies on the kube-apiserver for instructions on what PODs to load on its node,\n",
    "\n",
    "which was based on a decision made by the kube-scheduler which was stored in the ETCD datastore.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there was no kube-apiserver, and kube-scheduler and no controllers and no ETCD cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there was no master at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there were no other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you're all alone in the sea by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not part of any cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there anything that the kubelet can do as the captain on the ship?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can it operate as an independent node?\n",
    "\n",
    "If so who would provide the instructions required to create PODs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, the kubelet can manage a node independently. On this ship…err..host,\n",
    "\n",
    "we have the kubelet installed. And of course we have Docker as well to run containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no Kubernetes cluster. So there are no Kube API server or anything like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing that the kubelet knows to do is create PODs. But we don’t have an API server here to provide\n",
    "\n",
    "POD details.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now we know that to create a POD you need the details of the POD in a POD definition file. But how\n",
    "\n",
    "do you provide a pod definition file to the kubelet without a kube-api server?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can configure the kubelet to read the pod definition files from a directory on the server designated\n",
    "\n",
    "to store information about pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pods definition files in this directory the Kubelet periodically checks this directory for files\n",
    "\n",
    "reads these files and creates pods on the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does it create the pod it can ensure that the pod stays alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the application crashes, the kubelet attempts to restart it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you make a change to any of the file within this directory, the kubelet recreates the pod for those\n",
    "\n",
    "changes to take effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you remove a file from this directory the part is deleted automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these PODs that are created by the kubelet on its own without the intervention from the API server\n",
    "\n",
    "or rest of the kuberentes cluster components are known as Static PODs. Remember you can only create\n",
    "\n",
    "PODs this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot create replicasets or deployments or services by placing a definition file in the designated\n",
    "\n",
    "directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are all concepts part of the whole Kubernetes architecture, that requires other control plane components\n",
    "\n",
    "like the replication and deployment controllers etc. The kubelet works at a POD level and can only\n",
    "\n",
    "understand PODs. Which is why it is able to create static pods\n",
    "\n",
    "this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is that designated folder\n",
    "\n",
    "and how do you configure it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be any directory on the host. And the location of that directory is passed in to the kubelet\n",
    "\n",
    "as a option while running the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The option is named pod manifest path\n",
    "\n",
    "and here it is set to /etc/Kubernetes/manifests. There is also another way to configure this\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of specifying the option directly in the kubelet.service file,\n",
    "\n",
    "you could provide a path to another config file using the config option, and define the directory path\n",
    "\n",
    "as staticPodPath in that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clusters setup by the kubeadmin tool uses this approach. If you are inspecting an existing cluster, you\n",
    "\n",
    "should inspect this option of the kubelet to identify the path to the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then know where to place the definition file for your static pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "So keep this in mind when you go through the labs. You should know to view and configure this option\n",
    "\n",
    "irrespective of the method used to set up the cluster first check the option pod manifest path in the\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubelet service file if it's not there then look for the config option and identify the file used as\n",
    "\n",
    "the config file and then within the config file look for these static pod path option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either of these should give you the right path once the static ports are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "you can view them by running the Docker ps command. So why not the kubectl command as we have\n",
    "\n",
    "been doing so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember we don’t have the rest of the Kubernetes cluster. Kubectl utility works with the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-apiserver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don’t have an API server now, no kubectl utility. which is why we're using the docker command.\n",
    "\n",
    "So then how does it work when the node is part of a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there is an API server requesting the Kubelet to create pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can the kubelet create both kinds of PODs at the same time? Well, the way the kubelet works is it can\n",
    "\n",
    "take in requests for creating parts from different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is through the POD definition files from the static pods folder,\n",
    "\n",
    "as we just saw. The second, is through an HTTP API endpoint. And that is how the kube-apiserver provides\n",
    "\n",
    "input to kubelet. The kubelet\n",
    "\n",
    "can create both kinds of PODs – the staticpods and the ones from the api server - at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well,\n",
    "\n",
    "in that case is the API server aware of the static pods created by the kubelet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run the kubectl get pods command on the master node, the static pods will be listed as\n",
    "\n",
    "any other pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well how is that happening? When the kubelet creates a static pod,\n",
    "\n",
    "if it is part of a cluster, it also creates a mirror object in the kubeapi server.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you see from the kube-apiserver is just a read only mirror of the pod. You can view details\n",
    "\n",
    "about the pod but you cannot edit or delete it like the usual parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can only delete them by modifying the files from the nodes manifest folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the name of the part is automatically appended with the node name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case node01. So then why would you want to use Static PODs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since static pods are not dependent on the Kubernetes control plane, you can use static pods to deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "the control plane components itself as pods on a node. Start by installing kubelet on all the\n",
    "\n",
    "master nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then create pod definition files that uses Docker images of the various control plane components such\n",
    "\n",
    "as the api server, controller, etcd etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the definition files in the designated manifests folder. And kubelet takes care of deploying\n",
    "\n",
    "the control plane components themselves as PODs on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way you don't have to download the binaries configure services or worry about so the service is\n",
    "\n",
    "crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these services were to crash since it's a static pod it will automatically be restarted by\n",
    "\n",
    "the kubelet. Neat and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s how the kubeadmin tool set’s up a Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is why when you list the pods in the kube-system namespace, you see the control plane components\n",
    "\n",
    "as PODs in a cluster setup by the kubeadmin tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore that setup in the upcoming practice test. Before I let you go,\n",
    "\n",
    "one question that I get often is about the different between Static PODs and DaemonSets.\n",
    "\n",
    "DaemonSets as we saw earlier are used to ensure one instance of an application is available on all\n",
    "\n",
    "nodes in the cluster. It is handled by a daemonset controller through the kube-api server. Whereas static\n",
    "\n",
    "pods, as we saw in this lecture, are created directly by the kubelet without any interference from the\n",
    "\n",
    "kube-api server or rest of the Kubernetes control plane components. Static pods can be used to deploy\n",
    "\n",
    "the Kubernetes control plane components itself. Both static pods and pods created by daemonsets are\n",
    "\n",
    "ignored by the kube-scheduler. The kube-scheduler has no affect on these pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that’s it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice test and practice working with Static Pods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we look at the different ways of manually scheduling a POD on a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also look at how to view scheduler related events. We have seen how the default-scheduler works\n",
    "\n",
    "in a kubernetes environment in the previous lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has an algorithm that distributes pods across nodes evenly as well as takes into consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "the various conditions we specify through taints & tolerations and node affinity etc. But what if none\n",
    "\n",
    "of these satisfies your needs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have a specific application that requires its components to be placed on nodes after performing\n",
    "\n",
    "some additional checks. So you decide to have your own scheduling algorithm to place pods on nodes? So\n",
    "\n",
    "that you can add your own custom conditions and checks in it. Kubernetes is highly extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write your own kubernetes scheduler program, package it and deploy it as the default scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "or as an additional scheduler in the kubernetes cluster. That way\n",
    "\n",
    "all of the other applications can go through the default scheduler,\n",
    "\n",
    "however one specific application can use your custom scheduler. Your kubernetes cluster can have multiple\n",
    "\n",
    "schedulers at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a POD or a Deployment you can instruct kubernetes to have the POD\n",
    "\n",
    "scheduled by a specific scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we saw how to deploy the kube-scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We download the kube-scheduler binary and run it as a service with a set of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the option is scheduler name. If not specified\n",
    "\n",
    "It assumes in name of default scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kube-scheduler is the default scheduler. To deploy an additional scheduler,\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the same kube-scheduler binary or use one that you might have built for yourself, which makes\n",
    "\n",
    "more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we are going to use the same binary to deploy the additional scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time we set the scheduler name to a custom name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important to differentiate the two schedulers and this is the name that we will be specifying\n",
    "\n",
    "in the pod definition file later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at how it works with the kubeadm tool. The kubeadm\n",
    "\n",
    "tool deploys the scheduler as a POD.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the definition file it uses under the manifests folder. I have removed all the other details\n",
    "\n",
    "from the file so we can focus on the key parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command section has the command and associated options to start the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a custom scheduler by making a copy of the same file, and by changing the name of the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set the name of the pod to my-custom-scheduler and we add a new option to the scheduler command\n",
    "\n",
    "to set a custom name for the scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally an important option to look here is the leader-elect option. The leader-elect\n",
    "\n",
    "option is used when you have multiple copies of the scheduler running on different master nodes, in a\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability setup where you have multiple master nodes with the kube-scheduler process running\n",
    "\n",
    "on both of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple copies of the same scheduler are running on different nodes only one can be active at a\n",
    "\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where the leader-elect option helps in choosing a leader who will lead\n",
    "\n",
    "scheduling activities. We will discuss more about HA setup in another section, but for now I wanted\n",
    "\n",
    "to point out that, to get multiple schedulers working you must either set the leader-elect option to false,\n",
    "\n",
    "in case where you don’t have multiple masters. In case you do have multiple masters, you can pass in an\n",
    "\n",
    "additional parameter to set a lock object name.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to differentiate the new custom scheduler from the default during the leader election process\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, create the pod using the kubectl create command. Run the get pods command in the kube-system\n",
    "\n",
    "namespace and look for the new custom scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure its in a running state. The next step is to configure a new POD or a deployment to use\n",
    "\n",
    "the new scheduler. In the Pod specification file.\n",
    "\n",
    "add a new field called schedulerName and specify the name of the new scheduler.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way when the pod is created, the right scheduler picks it up to schedule. Create the pod using\n",
    "\n",
    "the kubectl create command. If the scheduler was not configured correctly, then the pod will continue\n",
    "\n",
    "to remain in a Pending state. If everything is good, then the pod will be in a Running state.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do you know which scheduler picked it up? View the events using the kubectl get events command.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lists all the events in the current namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for the Scheduled events. As you can see the source of the event is the custom scheduler we created.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the message says successfully assigned default/nginx image. To view the logs of the scheduler,\n",
    "\n",
    "view the logs of the pod using the kubectl logs command. Specify the name of the scheduler\n",
    "\n",
    "the correct namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice exercises and practice deploying multiple schedulers.\n",
