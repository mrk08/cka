    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss about the various options and tools available out there to validate your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with manual validation and then make our way to the tools available.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have provisioned your cluster and you think it's all done perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do you validate that? As we have seen so far in this course,\n",
    "\n",
    "kubernetes is a complex piece of software, or rather a complex mix of various different services and\n",
    "\n",
    "solutions. And we plan to host production applications on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is important to test our cluster to make sure all components are functioning as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many tools out there that can help us in performing such tests,\n",
    "\n",
    "but to begin with let’s see what we can check manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, given the knowledge you have gained through out this course, if you were asked to test a kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster, what would you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well I’d probably start by looking at the status of the nodes. See if they are all healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then check the status of the PODs running on the cluster, if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had control plane components deployed as pods, in case of a cluster deployed with kubeadm, then we can\n",
    "\n",
    "check to make sure that the pods in the kube-system namespace are running. Or else if the control plane\n",
    "\n",
    "components are deployed as services, then check the status of the services.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then check to see if we are able to deploy applications on the Cluster Try an nginx app\n",
    "\n",
    "and see if it deploys the pods correctly. Try scaling it to deploy multiple instances, to make sure\n",
    "\n",
    "pods get distributed across all the nodes in the cluster. Try exposing the application to test services\n",
    "\n",
    "and see if you're able to access. And of course you could run so many more tests to see if other features\n",
    "\n",
    "in the cluster are functioning such as secrets, encryption, security, storage, networking etc. And you’ll\n",
    "\n",
    "end up with 100s of such tests. All those tests that validate the cluster’s functionality on all areas\n",
    "\n",
    "together comprise the end to end tests. And that’s where test suites help you. Kubernetes has a supported\n",
    "\n",
    "test suite that can help us perform these tests. It’s maintained in the test-infra repository on github.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kube test runs about a 1000 different tests end to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tests are maintained by the kubernetes sigs or special interest groups who focus on specific\n",
    "\n",
    "areas. Such as the kubernetes API, the CLI, apps, authentication, networking, scheduling, storage etc. So the\n",
    "\n",
    "1000 tests are spread across each of these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how do these tests look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see some examples. In case of networking,\n",
    "\n",
    "it ensures that the network should function for intra-pod communication. Services should serve a basic\n",
    "\n",
    "endpoint from pods. Service endpoints latency should not be very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS should provide DNS for services.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few tests from the very many. In case of storage, it ensures that Secrets should\n",
    "\n",
    "be consumable from pods or as volumes in pods. ConfigMaps should be consumable from pods in a volume\n",
    "\n",
    "etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does it execute each test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example let's pick the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it test if one pod can reach another pod over http.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a sample output from the test. We will see how to run the test and how to view the output in\n",
    "\n",
    "the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test it usually builds in namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then creates the required objects within that namespace, such as the pods, waits for them to come up,\n",
    "\n",
    "and then performs the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case since we are checking connectivity it uses curl to test connectivity from one Pod to the\n",
    "\n",
    "other.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then records results and cleans up by deleting the namespace. We have been talking about this framework,\n",
    "\n",
    "as a tool to test an existing cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well while that's definitely one of the use cases the test infrastructure is much more than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can help in building kubernetes binaries, deploying a kubernetes cluster using those binaries,\n",
    "\n",
    "then running the test suite on that cluster and finally cleaning up by destroying the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if I were to build my own version of kubernetes or kubernetes based solution, I can use this test\n",
    "\n",
    "infrastructure to build deploy and test my solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say I built my own solution for kubernetes. For example an automation solution that can help in deploying\n",
    "\n",
    "a kubernetes cluster easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are so many tools out there but say mine does it better.\n",
    "\n",
    "It could be as simple as a script that runs and deploys a cluster in a matter of minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to prove to the world that my solution works and set’s up a kubernetes cluster that works and\n",
    "\n",
    "follows best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course I can use the Kubernetes test infrastructure to test my cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do I get kubernetes to certify me? Earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "we talked about the 1000 or so end to end tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are tests that test every functionality in a cluster and these may be different for different\n",
    "\n",
    "providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a cluster hosted on GCP may have tests relevant to GCP that are not relevant to a local cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "setup on prem.\n",
    "\n",
    "However out of the 1000 there are those that are common to any cluster. Any solution that claims\n",
    "\n",
    "itself to be a kubernetes based solution must pass a minimum of these approximately 160 tests categorized\n",
    "\n",
    "as conformance test.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tests the core set of interoperable features that a Kubernetes clusters must support.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my case I need to get the cluster my script set’s up to pass these conformance tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "I must then upload the results to the test-grid maintained by kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once approved, and once I go through the paperworks, I become a Kubernetes Certified solution provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how much time does it take to run these tests? In case of a full end-to-end test consisting of 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "it takes about 12 Hours to complete. For the conformance tests to complete it takes about 164\n",
    "\n",
    "tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "It takes about one to two hours. Another tool that is also often used to test a kubernetes cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "is Sonobuoy.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier to set up and get started and has an easier interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "However for this course, we will try to stick to the native kubernetes testing infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture in the next lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how to run these tests and how to view the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you will also do it yourself in the practice tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 190. End to End Tests - Run and Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296264#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will see how we can run and Analyze the results of E2E tests. On a kubernetes master node\n",
    "\n",
    "provided you have Golang installed, run the go get kubetest command to install kubetest locally. Once installed\n",
    "\n",
    "download the binaries required for the tests using the kubetest extract command with the relevant version\n",
    "\n",
    "of kubernetes you are running.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a kubernetes folder containing the required binaries in the current directory. cd into\n",
    "\n",
    "this directory and kick off the test using the command, kubetest test and specify the provider as skeleton\n",
    "\n",
    "and redirect output of the test to a text file. The provider option is used to specify where your cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "is hosted. On a local cluster, or cloud environment like GCP etc. In our case we use the keyword “skeleton”\n",
    "\n",
    "to specify a local cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if skeleton provider is used you must feed the API server details through environment variables,\n",
    "\n",
    "like kube_master_ip and kube_master. With those set, kick the tests off. The process starts and performs\n",
    "\n",
    "various tests on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command runs the entire end to end test suite that consists of about a 1000 different tests and takes\n",
    "\n",
    "about 12 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run a subset of these tests by passing in an additional argument like this to focus on conformance\n",
    "\n",
    "section alone or some specific feature set within the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This runs about one hundred and sixty four tests and takes about one and a half hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Viewing the results, you will see that it initially performs simple tests like comparing the kubectl\n",
    "\n",
    "server and client versions then goes on to checking the status of pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the tests you will see the summary of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of tests run which in this case is 166 out of 1008. Of which\n",
    "\n",
    "164 passed and 2 Failed. The failed tests are related to DNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case DNS did not provide a DNS for services or for the cluster. And so the test suite failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now see this in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 191. Smoke test\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296266#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We now perform a set of basic functionality testing to see if everything is working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we perform a basic health check to test the state of node and pods on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well they all look good.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we test data encryption. So we create a sacred object with the key my key and value my data\n",
    "\n",
    "We then query this in the ETCD cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the key is not seen in plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's encoded let us clean that up.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then create a deployment using the nginx image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait for that to be deployed\n",
    "\n",
    "we then expose it to a service of type node port\n",
    "\n",
    "within Fetch the port number, which in this case is 31518.\n",
    "\n",
    "within Fetch the port number, which in this case is 31518.\n",
    "\n",
    "then perform a curl to both the IP of the worker node and verify that it is successfully returning\n",
    "\n",
    "the nginx web page\n",
    "\n",
    "Check to make sure you can view the logs on the pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that you can execute a command within the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for the basic test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next demo will see how to run and validate and end to end test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 192. End to End test part1\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/learn/lecture/14296270#overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we will see how to run an end to end test on the cluster. To run this\n",
    "\n",
    "You need some additional resource requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't necessarily have to run this on the master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be run from any Linux system with preferably go installed on it. During this test,\n",
    "\n",
    "many workloads are going to be provisioned on these nodes. So you need additional memory as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to run it on my master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have increased the memory on the master node to 2 G.B. and the worker nodes to 1 TB on each. First\n",
    "\n",
    "make sure you have at least 7 to 10 TB of free space in the node that you're planning to run those tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we start by installing Go Lan on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we download Go LAN and configure the path variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the command go version to make sure it's installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next get the kubetest framework by running the go get kubetest command.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may take a few minutes for this to complete\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, extract the version of kubernetes release we are planning to test. In our case its 1.13.\n",
    "\n",
    "so run to test with the extract option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well and this may take a while.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once done, cd into the kubernetes directory\n",
    "\n",
    "You must set two environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "kube_master_ip and kube_master pointed to the load balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "Then kick off the test. We will just run the conformance tests only so we will provide that as the arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "in the test. The test should take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "So at the end of the test we will be given a summary of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "so here you can see that there are more than 150 test run and of which a majority of them passed and\n",
    "\n",
    "some of them failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see a summary of the test that failed."
