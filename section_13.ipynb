    "Hello and welcome to this section. In this section\n",
    "\n",
    "we look at some of the troubleshooting techniques for kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with troubleshooting application failures, then move on to troubleshooting control plane failures\n",
    "\n",
    "and then to a worker node failures and finally network related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is full of hands on labs where you are given a broken cluster and are asked to troubleshoot\n",
    "\n",
    "and fix issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course we have actually worked on a number of troubleshooting exercises with respect\n",
    "\n",
    "to the topic we were going through at that point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a lot of troubleshooting is already covered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through an overview of troubleshooting techniques and procedures and work on some more practice\n",
    "\n",
    "tests in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with application failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a two tier application that has a web and a database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database pod hosting a database and serving the web servers through a database service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The web server is hosted on a Web pod and serves users through the web service.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good to write down or draw a map or chart of how your application is configured\n",
    "\n",
    "before you start. Depending on how much you know about the failure you may choose to start from either\n",
    "\n",
    "end of this map.\n",
    "\n",
    "But remember to check every object and link in this map until you find the root cause of the issue. Say\n",
    "\n",
    "in our case,\n",
    "\n",
    "users report some issue with accessing the application. First.\n",
    "\n",
    "we start with the application front-end. Use standard ways of testing\n",
    "\n",
    "if your application is accessible. If it’s a web application, check if the web server is accessible on\n",
    "\n",
    "the IP of the node-port using curl. Next, check\n",
    "\n",
    "the service. Has it discovered endpoints for the web pod?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it did.\n",
    "\n",
    "But if it did not then you might want to check the service to pod discovery. Compare the selectors configured\n",
    "\n",
    "on the service to the ones on the pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure they match. Next,\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the pod itself and make sure it is in a running state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The status of the pod as well as the number of restarts can give you an idea of whether the application\n",
    "\n",
    "on the pod is running or is getting restarted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the events related to the pod using the described command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the logs of the application using the logs command. If the pod is restarting due to a failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the logs in the current version of the pod that that's running the current version of the container\n",
    "\n",
    "may not reflect why it failed the last time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you either have to watch these logs using the –f option and wait for the application to fail\n",
    "\n",
    "again or use the previous option to view the logs of a previous pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next check the status of the db-service as before. And finally check the DB pod itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the logs of the D.B. pod and look for any errors in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some more tips documented in the Kubernetes documentation page for Troubleshooting applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help in upcoming practice test as well as in the exam.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will see different ways of troubleshooting control plane failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by checking the status of the nodes in the cluster. See if they are all healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then check the status of the PODs running on the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had control plane components deployed as pods, in case of a cluster deployed with the kubeadm\n",
    "\n",
    "tool, then we can check to make sure that the pods in the kube-system namespace are running. Or else\n",
    "\n",
    "if the control plane components are deployed as services as in our case, then check the status of the\n",
    "\n",
    "services such as the kube-apiserver, controller-manager and scheduler on the master nodes. And the\n",
    "\n",
    "kubelet and kube-proxy service on the worker nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Next\n",
    "\n",
    "check the logs of the control plane components. Again, in case of kubeadm, use the kubectl logs command\n",
    "\n",
    "to view the logs of pods hosting the control plane components. In case of services configured natively\n",
    "\n",
    "on the master nodes, view the service logs using the host’s logging solution. In our case we could use\n",
    "\n",
    "the journalctl utility to view the kube-apiservers logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should be a good start.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more tips, refer to the Kubernetes documentation page for Troubleshooting Clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help in the upcoming practice test as well as in the exam.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will see different ways of troubleshooting worker node failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we start by checking the status of the nodes in the cluster. Are they reported as Ready or\n",
    "\n",
    "not ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "If they are reported as Not Ready, check details about the nodes using the kubectl describe node\n",
    "\n",
    "command. Each node has a set of conditions that can point us in a direction as to why a node might have\n",
    "\n",
    "failed. Depending on the status they are either set to true or false or unknown. When the node is out\n",
    "\n",
    "of this space\n",
    "\n",
    "the out of disk flag is that a true. When a node is out of memory the memory pressure flag is set to\n",
    "\n",
    "true. When the disk capacity is low, the disk pressure flag is set to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly when there are too many processes the PID Pressure flag is set to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally if the node as a whole is health the ready flag is set to true.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a worker node stops communicating with the master, may be due to a crash, these statuses are set to\n",
    "\n",
    "unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can indicate a possible loss of a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the last Heart Beat time field to find out the time when the node might have crashed. In such cases\n",
    "\n",
    "proceed to checking the status of the node itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the node is online at all or is crashed if it's crashed bring it back up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check for possible CPU, Memory, and Disk space on the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the status of the kubelet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the kubelet logs for possible issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check the kubelet certificates. Ensure they are not expired and that they are part of the right group, and that\n",
    "\n",
    "the certificates are issued by the right CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
