    "Hello! This is Mumshad Mannambeth\n",
    "\n",
    "and we are going through the Certified Kubernetes Administrators Course. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we discuss about Cluster maintenance related topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by looking at operating system upgrades.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see the implications of losing a node from the cluster where we take a node out of the cluster on\n",
    "\n",
    "purpose like for applying patches or upgrades on the OS itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then look at the cluster upgrade process.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we do that, we need to know a little bit about kubernetes releases and versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the best practices around upgrading, when to upgrade, what version to upgrade to etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we look at that first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you learn the upgrade procedure, you are asked to upgrade a cluster by yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will perform an end to an upgrade of a cluster yourself with live applications running on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally we look at some of the backup and restore methodologies. You will practice\n",
    "\n",
    "a disaster scenario where you take a backup of the kubernetes cluster, then go through a simulated\n",
    "\n",
    "disaster and then you're asked to recover from that disaster and bring the cluster back to the previous\n",
    "\n",
    "state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well fun stuff coming up so let's get started.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss about scenarios where you might have to take down node as part of your cluster say\n",
    "\n",
    "for maintenance purposes like upgrading a base software or applying patches like security patches etc\n",
    "\n",
    "on your cluster. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see the options available to handle such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have a cluster with a few notes and pods serving applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when one of these nodes go down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the pods on them are not accessible. Now depending upon how you deployed those PODs your users\n",
    "\n",
    "may be impacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, since you have multiple replicas of the blue pod, the users accessing the blue application\n",
    "\n",
    "are not impacted as they are being served through the other blue pod that's on line.\n",
    "\n",
    ". However users accessing the green pod, are impacted as that was the only pod running the green application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what does kubernetes do in this case?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the node came back online immediately, then the kubectl process starts and the pods come back\n",
    "\n",
    "onine.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the node was down for more than 5 minutes, then the pods are terminated from that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, kubernetes considers them as dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the PODs where part of a replicaset then they are recreated on other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time it waits for a pod to come back online is known as the pod eviction timeout and is set on\n",
    "\n",
    "the controller manager with a default value of five minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So whenever a node\n",
    "\n",
    "goes offline, the master node waits for upto 5 minutes before considering the node dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the node comes back on line after the pod eviction timeout it comes up blank without any pods scheduled\n",
    "\n",
    "on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the blue pod was part of a replicaset, it had a new pod created\n",
    "\n",
    "On another node. However since the green pod was not part of the replica set it's just gone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if you have maintenance tasks to be performed on a node if you know that the workloads running\n",
    "\n",
    "on the Node have other replicas and if it's okay that they go down for a short period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if you're sure the node will come back on line within five minutes you can make a quick upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "and reboot.\n",
    "\n",
    "However you do not for sure know if a node is going to be back on line in five minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well you cannot for sure say it is going to be back at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is a safer way to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can purposefully drain the node of all the workloads so that the workloads are moved to other nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well technically they are not moved. When you drain the node\n",
    "\n",
    "the pods are gracefully terminated from the node that they're on and recreated on another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The node is also cordoned or marked as unschedulable. Meaning no pods can be scheduled on this node until\n",
    "\n",
    "you specifically remove the restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the pods are safe on the others nodes, you can reboot the first node. When it comes back online\n",
    "\n",
    "it is still unschedulable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then need to uncordon it, so that pods can be scheduled on it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, remember the pods that were moved to the other nodes, don’t automatically fall back. If any of those\n",
    "\n",
    "pods where deleted or if new pods were created in the cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "Then they would be created\n",
    "\n",
    "on this node. Apart from drain and uncordon, there is also another command called cordon. Cordon simply\n",
    "\n",
    "marks a node unschedulable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike drain\n",
    "\n",
    "it does not terminate or move the pods on an existing node.\n",
    "\n",
    "It simply makes sure that new pods are not scheduled\n",
    "\n",
    "on that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice test and practice draining, cordoning and uncordoning a node.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will see you in the next lecture.\n",

    "Hello and welcome to this lecture. In this lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss about the various Kubernetes releases and versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we know about API versions in Kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "so far? We know that when we install a kubernetes cluster, we install a specific version of kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that when we run the kubectl get nodes command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case its v1.11.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will see how kubernetes project manages software releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at that version number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kubernetes release versions consists of 3 parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the major version, followed by the minor version and then the Patch version. While minor\n",
    "\n",
    "versions are released every few months with new features and functionalities,\n",
    "\n",
    "patches are released more often with critical bug fixes. Just like many other popular applications out\n",
    "\n",
    "there,\n",
    "\n",
    "kubernetes follows a standard software release versioning procedure. Every few month\n",
    "\n",
    "It comes out with new features and functionalities through a minor release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major version 1.0 was released in July of 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this recording the latest stable version is 1.13.0. Whatever we have seen here are stable\n",
    "\n",
    "releases of kubernetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from this you will also see alpha and beta releases all the bug fixes and improvements first go\n",
    "\n",
    "into an alpha release tagged alpha in this release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The features are disabled by default and maybe buggy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then from there they make their way to beta release where the code is well tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new features are enabled by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally they make their way to the main stable release.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find all the releases in the releases page of the Kubernetes Github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the kubernetes.tar.gz file and extract it to find executables for all the kubernetes\n",
    "\n",
    "components. The downloaded package when extracted has all the control plane components in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of them of the same version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that there are other components within the control plane that do not have the same version\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ETCD cluster and CoreDNS servers have their own versions as they are separate projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The release notes of each release provides information about the supported versions of externally\n",
    "\n",
    "dependent applications like ETCD and CoreDNS etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the links for some references.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was a quick overview of the release versions. In the upcoming lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "we will discuss how to upgrade from one version to another.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome to this lecture in this lecture we discuss about cluster upgrade process in Copernicus\n",
    "\n",
    "in the previous lecture we saw how common it is manages its software releases and how different components\n",
    "\n",
    "have their versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will keep dependency on external components like SCADA and coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ness aside for now and focus on the core control plane components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it mandatory for all of these to have the same version.\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components can be at different release versions since the cube API server is the primary component\n",
    "\n",
    "in the control plane and that is the component that all other components talked to.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the other components should ever be at a version higher than the cube API server the controller\n",
    "\n",
    "manager and scheduler can be at one version lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if cube API server was at X control or managers and cube schedulers can be at X minus one and the\n",
    "\n",
    "cube bullet and cube proxy components can be at two versions lower X minus two.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if cube API server was at 1.0 10 the controller manager and scheduler could be at 1.0 10 or 1.0 9\n",
    "\n",
    "and the cube let and cube proxy could be at 1.0 8 none of them could be at a version higher than the\n",
    "\n",
    "cube API server like 1.0 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is not the case with Cube control the cube control utility could be at 1.0 eleven it wasn't\n",
    "\n",
    "higher than the API server 1.0 10 the same version as the API server or at 1 the 9 inversion lower than\n",
    "\n",
    "the API server now this permissible SKU inversions allows us to carry out life upgrades we can upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "component by component if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when should you upgrade say you were at one or 10 and coordinate releases versions 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eleven and one 1.0 twelve at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cuban and US support only up to the recent three minor versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with one or two of being the latest release Cuban data supports versions 1.0 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not eleven and 1.0 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when one or 13 is released only versions 1.0 13 1.0 of and 1.0 eleven are supported before the release\n",
    "\n",
    "of one or 13 would be a good time to upgrade your cluster to the next release.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we upgrade do we upgrade directly from 1.0 10 to under 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "No.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended approach is to upgrade one minor version at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 1.0 10 one not 11 then 1.0 eleven to 1.0 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then one or two of two under 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upgrade process depends on how your cluster is setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if your cluster is a managed coordinate this cluster deployed on cloud service providers\n",
    "\n",
    "like Google for instance Google Coburn had its engine lets you upgrade your cluster easily with just\n",
    "\n",
    "a few clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deployed your cluster using tools like QB IDM then the tool can help you plan and upgrade the\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you deployed your cluster from scratch then you manually upgrade the different components of the\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will look at the options by cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you have a cluster with Master and worker nodes running in production hosting pods serving users\n",
    "\n",
    "the nodes and components are at version 1.0 10 upgrading a cluster involves two major steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you upgrade your master nodes and then upgrade the worker nodes while the master is being upgraded\n",
    "\n",
    "the control plane components such as the API server scheduler and controller managers go down briefly\n",
    "\n",
    "the master of going down does not mean your work or nodes and applications on the cluster are impacted\n",
    "\n",
    "all workloads hosted on the worker nodes continue to serve users as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Master is down all management functions are down you cannot access the cluster using cube\n",
    "\n",
    "control or other coordinates API you cannot deploy new applications or delete or modify existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller managers don't function either.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a power was to fail a new pod won't be automatically created.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as long as the nodes and the pods are up your applications should be up and users will not be impacted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the upgrade is complete and the cluster is back up it should function normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have the master and the master components had version 1.0 eleven and the worker nodes at version\n",
    "\n",
    "1.0 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier this is a supported configuration has now time to upgrade the worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different strategies available to upgrade the worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is to upgrade all of them at once but then your ports are down and users are no longer able to access\n",
    "\n",
    "the applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the upgrade is complete the nodes are back up new paths are scheduled and users can resume access.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's one strategy that requires downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second strategy is to upgrade one node at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So going back to the state where we have our master upgraded and nodes waiting to be upgraded we first\n",
    "\n",
    "upgrade the first node where the workloads move to the second and third node and users are so from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the first note is upgraded and backed up with an update the second node where the workloads move\n",
    "\n",
    "to the first and third nodes and finally the third node where the workloads are shared between the first\n",
    "\n",
    "two until we have all nodes upgraded to a newer version.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then follow the same procedure to upgrade the nodes from one dot eleven to under twelve and then\n",
    "\n",
    "one dot 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third strategy would be to add new node to the cluster nodes with newer software version.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially convenient if you're on a cloud environment where you can easily provision new nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "and decommission old ones nodes with the newer software version can be added to the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Move the workload over to the new and remove the old node until you finally have all new nodes with\n",
    "\n",
    "the new software version let us now see how it is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we were to upgrade this cluster from one dot 11 to under 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q radium has an upgraded command that helps in upgrading clusters with Cuba IDM run the Cuba idiom upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "plan command and it will give you a lot of good information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current cluster Virgin the two medium tool version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest table version of coordinators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it lists all the control plane components and their versions and what version these can be upgraded\n",
    "\n",
    "to.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also tells you that after we upgrade the control plane components you must manually upgrade the cube\n",
    "\n",
    "versions on each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember cube IDM does not install or upgrade cube LEDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally it gives you the command to upgrade the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that you must upgrade the cube ABM tool itself before you can upgrade the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cube medium 2 also follows the same software version as coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we're at 1.0 11 and we want to go to 1.0 13 but remember we can only go one minor version at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "so we first go to 1.0 twelve first upgrade the QB IDM tool itself to version 1.0 twelve then upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "the cluster using the command from the upgrade plan output Q medium upgrade apply it pulls the necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "images and upgrades the cluster components once complete your control plan components are now at 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "twelve if you run the cube control get nodes command you will still see the master node at 1.0 eleven.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because in the output of this command it is showing the versions of cube bullets on each of\n",
    "\n",
    "these notes registered with the API server and not the version of the API server itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the next step is to upgrade the cube let's remember depending on your setup you may or may not have\n",
    "\n",
    "cube LEDs running on your master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the cluster deployed with Cuba idiom has cube lets on the master node which are used to\n",
    "\n",
    "run the control plane components as part of the master not when we set up a cabinet this cluster from\n",
    "\n",
    "scratch later during this course we do not install cable it on the master and not you will not see the\n",
    "\n",
    "master node in the output of this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the next step is to upgrade CubeSat on the master node.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have cube lets on them run the NPT get upgrade cube let command for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the package is upgraded restart the cube lets service running the cube control get nodes command\n",
    "\n",
    "now shows that the master has been upgraded to 1.0 twelve the worker nodes are still at 1.0 eleven So\n",
    "\n",
    "next the worker nodes let us start one at a time we need to first move the workloads from the first\n",
    "\n",
    "worker node to the other nodes the cube control drain command lets you safely terminate all the ports\n",
    "\n",
    "from a node and we should use them on the other notes it also cordons the node and marks it unpredictable\n",
    "\n",
    "that way no new ports are scheduled on it then upgrade the cube atrium and cube let packages on the\n",
    "\n",
    "worker nodes as we did on the master node then using the cube radium to upgrade command update the node\n",
    "\n",
    "configuration for the new cube light version then restart the cube let service the node should now be\n",
    "\n",
    "up with the new software version however when we drain the node we actually marked it on schedule so\n",
    "\n",
    "we need to unmarked by running the command to control uncoordinated node one the node is now shadow\n",
    "\n",
    "level but remember that it is not necessary that the pods come right back to this note it is only marked\n",
    "\n",
    "as shadow level only when the parts are deleted from the other nodes or when new ports are scheduled\n",
    "\n",
    "do they really come back to this first not well it will soon come when we take down the second node\n",
    "\n",
    "to perform the same steps to upgrade and finally the third not we now have all nodes upgraded Well let's\n",
    "\n",
    "set for this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Head over to the practice test where you will practice upgrading and live cluster with applications\n",
    "\n",
    "running on it without taking the applications down good luck.\n",

    "Let’s start by looking at what you should consider backing up in a Kubernetes cluster. So far in\n",
    "\n",
    "this course,\n",
    "\n",
    "we have deployed a number of different applications on our Kubernetes cluster using deployment, pod\n",
    "\n",
    "and Service definition files.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the ETCD cluster is where all cluster related information is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if your applications are configured with persistent storage then that is another candidate for backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to resources that we created in the cluster,\n",
    "\n",
    "at times we used the imperative way of creating an object by executing a command. Such as while creating\n",
    "\n",
    "a namespace or a secret or config map or at times for exposing applications. And at times we used\n",
    "\n",
    "the declarative approach by first creating a definition file and then running the kubectl apply\n",
    "\n",
    "command on that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the preferred approach if you want to save your configuration. Because now you have all the objects\n",
    "\n",
    "required for a single application in the form of object definition files in a single folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can easily be reused at a later time or shared with others of course you must have a copy of these\n",
    "\n",
    "files saved at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good practice is to store these on source code repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way it can be maintained by a team the source code repository should be configured with the right\n",
    "\n",
    "backup solutions. With managed/public source code repositories like Github\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to worry about this.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that even when you lose your entire cluster you can redeploy your application on the cluster by\n",
    "\n",
    "simply applying this configuration files on them. While the declarative approach is the preferred approach\n",
    "\n",
    "it is not necessary that all of your team members stick to those standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if someone created an object the imperative way without documenting that information anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a better approach to backing up resource configuration is to use query the kube-api server. . Query the kube-api\n",
    "\n",
    "server using kubectl or by accessing the API server directly and save all resource configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "for all objects created on the cluster has a copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example one of the commands that can be used in a backup script is to get all pods, deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "and services in all namespaces using the kubectl utility’s get all command and extract the output\n",
    "\n",
    "in a YAML format. Then save that file. And that’s just for a few resources groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other resource groups that must be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you don't have to develop that solutions yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tools like ARK or now called Velero by Heptio that can do this for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can help in taking backups of your Kubernetes cluster using the Kubernetes API. Let us now move\n",
    "\n",
    "on to ETCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ETCD cluster stores information about the state of our cluster. So information about the cluster itself,\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes and every other resource as created within the cluster are stored here.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of backing up resource as before, you may chose to backup the ETCD server itself. As we have\n",
    "\n",
    "seen the ETCD cluster is hosted on the master nodes. While configuring ETCD we specified a location\n",
    "\n",
    "where all the data would be stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data directory. That is the directory that can be configured to be backup by your backup tool. ETCD\n",
    "\n",
    "also comes with a built in snapshot solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can take a snapshot of the ETCD database by using the etdctl utilities snapshot save command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the snapshot a name snapshot.db. A snapshot file is created by the name in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to be created in another location specified the full path.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the status of the backup using the snapshot status command. To restore the cluster from\n",
    "\n",
    "this backup at a later point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "first stop the kube-api server service, as the restore process will require you to restart the ETCD\n",
    "\n",
    "cluster and the kube-api server depends on it. Then run the etcdctl’s snapshot restore command\n",
    "\n",
    "with the path set to the path of the backup file which is the snapshot.db file. When ETCD restores\n",
    "\n",
    "from a backup, it initializes a new cluster configuration and configures the members of ETCD as new\n",
    "\n",
    "members to a new cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to prevent a new member from accidentally joining an existing cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example, you use this backup snapshot to provision a new etcd-cluster for testing purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t want the members in the new test cluster to accidentally join the production cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "So during a restore you must specify a new cluster token and the same initial cluster configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "options specified in the original configuration file. On running this command a new data directory is\n",
    "\n",
    "created.\n",
    "\n",
    "in this example at location /var/lib/etcd-from-backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then configure the ETCD configuration file to use the new cluster-token and data directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reload the service daemon and restart etcd service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally start the kube-apiserver service. Your cluster should now be back in the original state. A quick\n",
    "\n",
    "note before I let you go With all the ETCD commands\n",
    "\n",
    "remember to specify the certificate files for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specify the endpoint to the ETCD cluster and the ca certificate, the etcd-server certificate and\n",
    "\n",
    "the key, So we have seen two options and backup using ETCD and backup by querying the kube-apiserver .\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these have their pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well if you're using a managed Kubernetes environment then at times you may not even have access to\n",
    "\n",
    "the ETCD cluster in that case\n",
    "\n",
    "Backup by querying the kube-apiserver probably the better way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's it for this demo.\n",
